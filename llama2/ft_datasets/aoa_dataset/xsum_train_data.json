Georgians maintained their faith over the centuries despite the waves of invading hordes, including the armies of Ghengis Khan and Tamerlane.\nAlthough the Soviets permitted religion to be practised, its reach was severely limited. In 1917, there were 2,455 working churches in Georgia, but by the mid-1980s there were only 80, along with a few monasteries and a seminary.\n\"During communism, the church was outdated, something for old ladies,\" says political analyst Ghia Nodia.\nThat attitude quickly changed after independence in 1991, when the elected president, Zviad Gamsakhurdia, espoused a philosophy of ethnic nationalism, which the Church embraced.\n\"During the (Gamsakhurdia) national movement, the concept that real Georgians are Orthodox Christians spread really fast,\" Mr Nodia says.\nOver 80% of Georgia's 4.5 million people say they belong to the Georgian Orthodox Church, however, experts claim only about 15% - 25% actively participate in rituals.\nNevertheless, the Orthodox Church remains the most trusted institution in Georgia. In a February survey carried out by the Caucasus Resource Research Center (CRRC), 95% of respondents had a favourable opinion of its work.\nBeka Mindiashvili, a former theologian who is now head of the Tolerance Center at the public defender's office, attributes such high confidence in the Church to the 80-year-old Patriarch, Ilia II.\n\"He possesses all the right attributes. He is charismatic, he speaks slowly and each word is regarded saintly, holy,\" Mr Mindiashvili says.\n\"He is a person for everybody. To a simple person, he speaks simply; to a politician, he speaks politically; to an intellectual, he speaks of Umberto Eco and of classical music. And he acquired absolute power in the Church all by himself.\"\nThere were only about 50 priests when Ilia II became patriarch in 1977. Today there are approximately 1,700.\nHis first major test in power was in 1997, when a number of anti-ecumenical abbots threatened to break communion with him for being too liberal. He avoided a schism by breaking off ecumenical activities and pursuing what philosopher Zaza Piralishvili calls an \"imitation of medieval rhetoric\".\nExamples of the Church's ultra-conservative interventions included warnings that yoga was full of false \"charms\" that lured people away from God as well as a recent mass mobilisation against ID cards after some Georgian Orthodox leaders claimed the cards bore the mark of the anti-Christ.\nThe Church is recognised for maintaining a neutral political stance and Ilia II is renowned for playing a significant role as mediator in political confrontations, which in Georgia can easily turn violent.\nProfessor Iago Kachkachishvili, head of the sociology department at Tbilisi State University, says the Church's political neutrality is a myth.\n\"The Church's influence comes from public opinion,\" he says. \"It uses the trust of the people as a source of strength. And every government and politician uses the Georgian Orthodox Church as a source of legitimacy.\"\nWhile the constitution stipulates a separation between church and state, a 2002 concordat defined this relationship by granting the Church official recognition in Georgia and a special consultative role in the government, particularly in education.\nIn 2009, Mikheil Saakashvili's government awarded the Church a $15m (\u00c2\u00a310m) grant - three times the amount of the previous year - and presented luxury sports utility vehicles to each of the 10 archbishops.\nDespite the lavish gifts, many conservative elements within the Church, who are pro-Russian, openly voiced their displeasure with the president. They saw his pro-Western orientation as a threat to Georgian traditions and the Church's influence on the people.\nThe clash of ideologies came to head in July 2011, when parliament passed a law allowing religious minority groups in Georgia to be registered as legal entities in public law giving them legal protection previously only enjoyed by the Orthodox Church.\nThe move was applauded in the West, but the Georgian Orthodox Church saw this as an infringement on its special status.\nAlthough Ilia II requested the clergy to maintain neutrality in the 2012 parliamentary elections, many priests broke ranks and openly supported the coalition of billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili, who had provided the funds to build Tbilisi's Sameba Cathedral, the largest church in Georgia.\nBut on 13 May, Bidzina Ivanishvili who by now was prime minister, took an independent stance and became the first Georgian politician to declare openly that sexual minorities were equal citizens of this country.\nThree days later, Ilia II called on the authorities to ban the 17 May demonstration. This marked the first open confrontation between church and state and culminated in expletive-shouting priests chasing gay activists down the main streets of the capital.\nProtesters broke through barricades and police were forced to bus the small number of activists out of the area for their protection.\nThe day after the attacks, Tbilisi artist Magda Guruli joined some 100 people who rallied in the city centre to call for justice.\nShe believes the response to the protest was a manifestation of the patriarch's power over the state.\n\"I'm here to say give me back my religion,\" she said. \"Orthodoxy is part of our culture, but who are these people who try to influence society and try to influence their thoughts and try to cultivate blind faith?\""

February retail sales jumped 10.9% from the previous year.\nWhile we should always remain sceptical of the Chinese government's GDP data, these figures suggest that growth is stabilising.\nHowever, they also demonstrate that Beijing is relying on the same old tricks to drive its economy.\nGovernment spending on infrastructure, a booming property market and taking on debt were all things China's leadership has pledged to move away from in the transition towards a new, modern, open economy.\nYet all three factors are still evident in this data, suggesting that the \"old\" model of growth that relies so much on the state is alive and well.\nDebt is a particular concern. China's total and private debt is now worth more than 250% of GDP and looks set to grow. Analysts are divided about just how equipped China is to handle that much debt, but even the government has said the situation is not ideal and must be addressed.\nThe question is just how much political appetite there will be to accept a less-than-glamorous growth rate in a year when President Xi Jinping has arguably his most important party congress coming up.\nChina is a key driver of the global economy and its performance is closely watched by investors around the world. Its 2016 growth was its slowest in 26 years.\nHidenobu Tokuda of the Mizuho Research Institute in Tokyo said China should be trying to slow its growth rate in the long term, though \"uncertainties remain high\" about how that slowdown would happen.\nMeanwhile Brian Jackson of IHS Global Insight predicted both industrial output and the property sector would slow."

Some of it may not be.\n\"Mr Putin is well aware of my feelings about this, because I spoke to him directly about it.\"\nIt is not clear what action the US intends to take, with Mr Obama leaving office on 20 January.\nThe disclosure of emails was embarrassing to the Democratic Party at a crucial point in the election campaign.\nThe CIA has concluded that Russia's motivation was to sway the election in favour of Mr Trump, but no evidence has been made public.\n18 revelations from Wikileaks emails\nMr Trump has accused the Democrats of fabricating Russian involvement to hide their embarrassment at the election defeat.\nHe has also long expressed admiration for Mr Putin, and his pick for secretary of state - oil tycoon Rex Tillerson, who has worked closely with the Russian leader - has raised concerns.\nMr Trump tweeted on Thursday: \"If Russia, or some other entity, was hacking, why did the White House wait so long to act? Why did they only complain after Hillary lost?\"\nHowever, the Obama administration in October directly accused Russia of hacking US political sites and email accounts with the aim of interfering with the upcoming election.\nThe president-elect has been assembling his new administration and on Thursday he said he would pick lawyer David Friedman to be his ambassador to Israel.\nThe Russian president's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, dismissed the claims of Mr Putin's involvement as \"laughable nonsense\" on Thursday.\nAnd on Friday, he said: \"They should either stop talking about it or provide, at last, some evidence. Otherwise, it all looks rather unseemly,\" according to RIA Novosti.\nDemocrats have struggled to grasp why Hillary Clinton lost. Could it be the spread of \"fake news\"? A poor Democratic ground game in Midwestern states? FBI Director James Comey's last-minute letter to Congress about new Clinton emails?\nAnything but acknowledge that Donald Trump turned out to be the more effective candidate with a more appealing message (at least in the states that mattered).\nRussian government hackers are the latest culprit - or scapegoat, depending on one's perspective. They're a tempting target, however, given the latest accounts of intrigue from intelligence community sources. A wily Vladimir Putin overseeing damaging leaks makes for a deliciously villainous plot.\nOf course those campaign emails, while certainly an annoyance to Democrats, likely weren't enough to tilt the election. But that doesn't mean these revelations won't be a headache for a president-elect who bristles when challenged.\nNow he's feuding with his own intelligence services and lashing out on Twitter, virtually guaranteeing more leaks. A congressional investigation seems likely. There's even talk of a Russian sanctions bill ending up on President Trump's desk.\nMrs Clinton's loss still stings, but for forlorn Democrats seeing Mr Trump squirm would be a salve for open wounds."

The federation has been so supportive, we were given everything we needed: uniforms or equipment.\n\"It was tough but us players we had faith and determination - and our spirit motivated us.\"\nKinuthia also revealed the players were driven by their belief they were good enough to qualify - despite their lowly Fifa ranking of 133rd in the world - and also by a desire to shown those Kenyans who are critical of women's football that the sport is not solely for men.\n\"We told each other we would qualify if we were given the chance,\" she said. \"We know Kenya ladies have the talent, we just lack exposure.\n\"We wanted to make people realise that women can make it and since last year we have been singing a song 'women will qualify first before the men'.\n\"For the first time it has happened. In the past it was all about the Harambee Stars but now it is about the Harambee Starlets.\"\nThis is a turning point for Kenya women's football\nKinuthia is not content to sit back and revel in the team's achievement. She is eager for the team to use qualification as a platform for greater success.\n\"Now we have qualified for the Nations Cup I think we will improve the Fifa ranking and we will perform better,\" she said.\n\"Our target is to finish in the top four at the tournament and book our place at the the 2019 World Cup.\"\nTeam manager Doreen Nabwire is working on a plan to make that dream come true.\n\"This is a turning point for Kenya women's football, \" she said.\n\"We are planning for a domestic league, which is supposed to be kick off next month and I hope the players will have adequate time to prepare.\n\"The league will help the players to prepare, allowing them to play at the highest level and to compete, ensuring their fitness levels are maintained.\n\"The president of the federation is also trying to organise a training camp for two or three weeks, in Japan, China, Germany or the USA.\n\"The plans are under way, we also want to move around the country playing friendly matches - against boys or girls - and ensure we are active.\n\"Our team is young, we have maybe two experienced players, but we believe our young players have what it takes to take us to the next level.\""

And if someone told me to go out and knock a fairy fort or touch it, I would starve first.\"\nThe issue was raised at Kerry County Council, where Mr Healy-Rae's daughter, Maura, is a councillor, last week.\nShe told a council meeting that her father was convinced fairies were in the area of the road problems.\nMr Healy-Rae also raised the issue at Kerry County Council in 2007 when he was a councillor, asking if a dip in the N22 near Curraglass was caused by \"fairies at work\".\nThe Irish Times reports that the council's road department replied that it was due to a \"deeper underlying subsoil/geotechnical problem\".\nMr Healy-Rae, whose brother Michael is also a TD, has previously hit the headlines for comments in which he denied any human impact on climate change and said that \"God above\" controlled the weather."

from high-end vehicles with comprehensive branding, to extensive catering for the masses and cash allowances for the thousands of delegates who attended.\nBut now the hard work begins - to ensure baby Jubilee lives up to expectation and delivers political victory for its parents.\nPrior to Saturday, Mr Kenyatta and Mr Ruto were living in what Kenyans call a \"come-we-stay\" relationship - an unofficial marriage that has not been endorsed by the parents.\nThe pair came together informally in early 2011 when the rival communities they represent decided to bury their differences, which were at their most destructive when hundreds of people died and thousands others were displaced following the disputed elections of 2007.\nThe two men went on joint rallies across the country to preach peace and heal the bitter rift between their two communities.\nThe rallies then took on an urgent stride as both men faced charges of crimes against humanity at the International Criminal Court (ICC).\nThe cases were later dropped.\nMr Kenyatta's political parent is The National Alliance (TNA), which he used to secure the presidency in 2013, while Mr Ruto became his deputy running under his own United Republican Party (URP).\nTNA and URP are now dead and Mr Kenyatta and Mr Ruto are one - assuming the roles of Jubilee party leader and deputy respectively.\nNow Mr Kenyatta and Mr Ruto have to attend to the duties every parent faces - ensuring baby Jubilee is vaccinated against all forms of political threats and gets a good education to attain the grades needed to secure victory in the 2017 election.\nOn the face it, Jubilee appears to be a platform to simply retain power in a convincing win next year.\nTo do this Jubilee needed to have more national outlook beyond its mainly Kikuyu and Kalenjin core support.\nAnd so Mr Kenyatta and Mr Ruto have been on a sustained charm offensive to parts of the country and communities that tend to support the opposition such as the Coastal region.\nJoseph Warungu:\n\"The new party is really about one man and one issue: William Ruto and the 2022 general election.\"\nThe harvest was plentiful.\nTwelve parties folded up, gave up their identity and turned red - the colour of Jubilee.\nMore than 40 opposition legislators suddenly found reason to reject the parties that sent them to parliament or the Senate and decided that east or west Jubilee was best.\nThe Jubilee party is now confident that it is ready to take on the opposition in next year's election.\nThey are so confident that in his party launch address, President Kenyatta told the main opposition Cord coalition, led by Raila Odinga, that they should \"get their act together so that we can face one another in a peaceful manner [during the election]\".\nCord is yet to name its presidential candidate.\nBut at a deeper level the new party is really about one man and one issue: William Ruto and the 2022 general election.\nHe, more than President Kenyatta, will need this new platform the most.\nMany observers argue that although the real brutal and unpredictable competition will be at the local county level, at national level President Kenyatta himself is in a strong position to win re-election in 2017 for several reasons.\nHis Jubilee party has very deep pockets and continues to command wide support from the Kikuyu and Kalenjin - the two communities that have been the only ones to occupy the presidency since the country's independence in 1963.\nJubilee is in government and that comes with its advantages.\nJubilee has also made some inroads into parts of the opposition territory to woo other communities, and is working round the clock to try and deliver some of the commitments it made in its 2013 election manifesto.\nBut most importantly, the opposition has not taken political advantage of some of Jubilee's failures including its poor record in fighting corruption, weak rule of law and the continued growth of nepotism and tribalism in public appointments.\nMr Kenyatta has one more thing going for him - very few African incumbents lose elections. When they do, it's out of carelessness or empty pockets.\nSo Mr Ruto is looking beyond 2017 to the 2022 election, when he is meant to replace Mr Kenyatta as the Jubilee presidential candidate.\nHe needs the new binding Jubilee platform because he cannot fully trust his Kikuyu political \"in-laws\" to back him the way he's backed them up to now.\nIn the recent past there were prominent Kikuyu politicians who openly said Mr Ruto should not count on automatic Kikuyu support when his turn comes.\nSecondly Kenyan politicians can be restless grasshoppers - jumping from party to party depending on where the grass is greenest.\nThe new Jubilee platform and a new law that prevents such party political hopping means those inside Jubilee will be locked in.\nThirdly, Mr Ruto is a bold politician who has a single focus on the big picture ahead.\nHis fearless march tends to leave bruised souls who would jump at any opportunity to oppose him.\nHis planning therefore is meticulous and does not leave things to chance.\nIn addition to the Jubilee platform, there is widespread talk in Kenya that he has placed his allies in key public institutions.\nSo with the birth of baby Jubilee, Mr Ruto and Mr Kenyatta are now in the business of changing diapers and buying lots of toys for the baby to ensure they themselves don't see red at the next election.\nMore from Joseph Warungu:"

The occupants of each got out and three items were taken from the lorry.\nThe handover was witnessed by police.\nThe items were later found to be 40kg of cannabis, 1kg of cocaine and 25kg of benzocaine, a mixing agent for cocaine.\nAt the same time, police observed a Vauxhall Astra parked outside a house in Park Avenue, Cookstown.\nPaul Currie was seen carrying items to this car, which was stopped shortly after moving off.\nSearches at a number of properties in Cookstown led to the recovery of \u00a382,000 in cash.\nA search of a house in Lammy Lane, Dessertmartin, which is connected to Currie Snr, uncovered 11kg of cannabis resin and 3kg of herbal cannabis.\nThe detective pointed out that, whilst Currie Jnr has a very limited record, his father has multiple drugs convictions, and has served a total of 16 years in prison for such offences.\nHe said police \"place the men high in an organised crime grouping, although we believe there are others higher\".\n\"Class A drug use is inherently on the rise in Northern Ireland, with needle exchanges high and three drug-related deaths in the Mid-Ulster area in recent weeks,\" he added.\nAt this point, the detective was interrupted by defence counsel for both men, who argued the information was not related to his clients' cases and should not be put forward.\nHowever, the judge allowed the detective to continue, ruling \"such comments are in the public interest\".\nThe detective added: \"I am trying to say there is a safety concern for the public. Both men are unemployed, but they clearly have funds to buy drugs.\n\"Police believe there is a strong likelihood of reoffending and feel there are no bail conditions which could prevent further offending. Police feel that, if bailed, they will return to offending to support themselves financially.\"\nThe judge agreed to release Stephen Currie on strict terms, including a \u00a35,000 surety.\nHe is also ordered to have no contact with Loughlin, not to leave Northern Ireland and to surrender his passport.\nThe judge refused Currie Snr bail, citing concerns he is \"wedded to a career as drug dealer\".\nThe case is due back in court on 21 December."

As one of American Sniper's producers, he will receive an Oscar if Clint Eastwood's film wins best picture.\nThe critics said: \"American Sniper hinges on Cooper's restrained yet deeply expressive lead performance, allowing many of the drama's unspoken implications to be read plainly in the actor's increasingly war-ravaged face. Cooper, who packed on 40 pounds for the role, is superb here; full of spirit and down-home charm early on, he seems to slip thereafter into a sort of private agony that only those who have truly served their country can know.\" Justin Chang, Variety.\nAge: 38\nNominated for: The Imitation Game\nThe character: Alan Turing, the computer pioneer who played a key role in cracking the Enigma code used by the Nazis during World War Two.\nOscar record: This is a first nomination for Cumberbatch.\nThe critics said: \"With a large dose of Sherlock and a sprinkling of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, Benedict Cumberbatch is just brilliant in the role of Alan Turing, the Second World War codebreaker in The Imitation Game.

That compares to Mach 2 for Concorde.\nThe patent application says that the aeroplane would use a variety of engines that would serve different purposes and power would come from hydrogen stored onboard.\nTwo turbojets under the fuselage and a rocket motor in the rear would be used during take-off. It would lift off vertically like a Space Shuttle.\nOnce launched, the turbojets would be shut down and retracted and the rocket motor would then kick in to climb to an altitude of more than 100,000 feet.\nThen ramjets, more usually used on missiles, would be ignited and the flight would reach a top speed of Mach 4.5.\nPatentYogi, a website dedicated to explaining patent ideas, said the flight path of the jet would make it the \"highest rollercoaster ride in the world\".\nThe jet would come with hammock-like seats  for passengers to sit in - necessary if they wanted to travel in comfort.\nTravellers wouldn't have to share the cabin with hundreds of others - the patent application describes it as more of a private jet carrying just 20 passengers at a time.\nThe idea would also not be limited to commercial flights. In the patent, Airbus also lists military applications for the jet.\nAirbus took the iconic Concorde out of service in 2003 because of high operating costs.\nIn the 1970s, the supersonic jet faced complaints about the sonic booms and noise pollution created by its four turbojet engines.\nAs a result it was banned from operating over land and was never able to become financially viable, operating instead as a high-altitude transatlantic taxi service for the super-rich.\nThe patent application for the new jet does address the issue of sonic booms. By climbing almost vertically the new design's sonic boom would be dissipated in all directions and not reach the ground.\nAnd the design has echoes of the curves of Concorde, with what is described as a \"gothic delta wing\".\nDon't get too excited yet.\nA vast number of patent applications don't ever see the light of day as real products although technology described in it may find its way into some Airbus products.\nAirbus itself was certainly playing down the patents, saying in a statement that the designs were based on \"concepts and ideas in a very nascent stage of conceptualisation\".\nIn fact the idea was first published in 2011 and has only now started being publicised because it has won approval from the US Patent Office.\nBack then Airbus, then known as the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS), said it would take 30 to 40 years to enter service, if at all.\nAirbus did say that it is working on two hypersonic projects, one with Japanese partners and another with Russian and Australian involvement, with the aim of conquering speeds up to Mach 6."

Even rigging the Ryder Cup qualifying process to lure more stars to Paris is not enough for some to change schedules.\nYes, the French Open field can boast four times major winner Rory McIlroy and Masters Champion Danny Willett, but the likes of Sergio Garcia, Justin Rose and last week's victor in Germany, Henrik Stenson are absent.\nThis must be a source of disappointment to the Tour and it's chief executive, Keith Pelley. After all, they have compromised the integrity of Ryder Cup qualifying in trying to produce the strongest possible field.\nPoints earned at Le Golf National will be doubled for the tables that determine the European team that defends the trophy at Hazeltine this September. The winner receives 64 points on the world ranking list and a million points on the European list.\nThe leading four players on the order of merit based European table and the top five from the world ranking standings create the nine automatic qualifiers.\nFurthermore, for the first time there are no points on offer at the World Golf Championships event in Akron, Ohio which is also being played this week.\nThis is the European Tour standing up to its more powerful American counterparts, but at what cost?\nThey have played politics against the PGA Tour and with the qualifying tables but Darren Clarke's line up may be adversely affected.\nIf Ireland's Shane Lowry were to successfully defend his WGC title he would receive no qualifying credit despite beating a higher ranked field than whoever wins the French Open.\nThe same goes for Rose, Scotland's Russell Knox, Sweden's David Lingmerth and Soren Kjeldsen, of Denmark.\nIt is fair to say Clarke would want players capable of winning tournaments headlined by the likes of Jason Day and Jordan Spieth in his team. In his heyday, it was winning these sort of events that helped make the captain a fixture in the Ryder Cup team.\nOf course, the skipper will take due note and successful Europeans in Ohio would do their chances of a wildcard pick no harm at all.  But this might mean Clarke having to use a pick on someone who would otherwise have qualified automatically.\nThere is something rather unsettling about manipulating the qualification process for a mainstay as important as the Ryder Cup to boost a single tournament.\nBut the Tour clearly felt it was necessary to ensure the French Open did not suffer unduly when a World Golf Championships event was scheduled at the same time.\nThis clash was brought about because of golf's return to the Olympics.  It meant there was no room for the WGC in its usual early August slot between the Open and PGA Championship.\nAnd here is another area where players are putting themselves first rather than their sport.\nThe growing list of Rio absentees from the men's tournament is threatening to undermine the credibility of golf's regained Olympic status.\nMcIlroy's withdrawal from the Irish team because of his fears over the Zika virus was swiftly followed by South African Branden Grace. They join Vijay Singh, Marc Leishman, Adam Scott, Louis Oosthuizen and Charl Schwartzel in choosing to stay away.\nIt is hard to criticise anyone who cites health fears, especially Leishman whose wife has a compromised immune system following serious illness last year.\nHowever it does feel as though the male golfers are out of step with pretty much the rest of the Olympic movement despite assurances that the Zika threat is low.\nThe tournament takes place in winter when there are few mosquitoes and the course is close to the sea which again minimises the threat.\nMembers of the International Olympic Committee will not be impressed when they assess golf's right to stay in the Games next year. \"I think it is appalling,\" Canadian representative Barry Maister told a New Zealand radio station.\n\"Once they've got in, they have got to deliver. Just getting in with your name, and then putting up some second or third rate players, is so far from the Olympic ideal or the expectation of the Olympic Movement.\n\"The Olympics is about the best, and they pledged the best. Quite frankly, any sport that cannot deliver its best athletes, in my view, should not be there.\"\nSignificantly, no women have withdrawn from the Olympics. They are the ones in most need of the exposure the Games will provide.\nBy turning up to play they are acting in their own best interests and in that regard they are no different to their male counterparts."

He has proved this year that he is a special talent.'\"\nBy BBC Radio Leeds' Dave Callaghan\n\"Zafar Ansari's inclusion in the England Test squad for the winter series against Pakistan was richly deserved, although a thumb injury has cast doubt on his involvement.\n\"In taking more than 40 wickets with his left-arm spin, Ansari has bowled with great skill and control and has worked really well in tandem with Gareth Batty.\n\"With the bat, Ansari has scored more than 700 Championship runs at the top of the order, but he also averaged more than 40 in the T20 Blast.\n\"His bowling and batting were also a key component in Surrey's journey to Lord's for the One-Day Cup final, which sadly he missed because of his injury.\"\nBy BBC London 94.9's Mark Church\n\"The Middlesex pace bowler skittled Durham almost single-handedly at Lord's early in May, in a display which in one half-hour saw five wickets fall for just nine runs.\n\"Starting with a bang, Harris has been relentless all season, second only to Chris Rushworth in the total wickets tally in Division One, and his recent five-for against champions Yorkshire gave further evidence that he can mix with the best of them.\n\"It's a far cry from last year when he found himself unable to feature regularly in the Championship side, and was sent back on loan to his old club Glamorgan to get overs under his belt.\n\"At only 25, and with the ability to score crucial lower-order runs, if Harris continues to mature at the rate he currently is, further honours may well follow.\"\nBy BBC Sport's Isabelle Westbury\n\"Tom Curran has been outstanding for Surrey this season. With more than 60 Championship wickets at an average of just 24, he has led the attack and delivered for the team on a consistent basis.\n\"At times he has simply destroyed top-order batsmen with his pace and movement, and with the white ball he has also shown tremendous skill and a very cool head for one so young.\n\"With the bat he has made valuable runs in all forms of the game and has shown he is a genuine all-rounder.\n\"Curran has only missed one game this season when he was rested for a T20 match and has bowled nearly 500 overs in Championship cricket. He qualifies for England at the end of October, so how he was not included in the Lions T20 squad for the winter is quite beyond me.\"\nBy BBC London 94.9's Mark Church\n\"This Rambo bandanaman, headhunted by Yorkshire in 2012, is a dead-cert consistent wicket-taker in first-class cricket and shows real class with the new ball.\n\"His pace is not in vogue with the England selectors, but his full-length attacking attitude and nagging accuracy should not be underestimated.\n\"After 68 Championship wickets last season, Brooks has also proved he is no one-season wonder and will again be a key figure as Yorkshire target a third successive title in 2016.\"\nBy BBC Sport's Isabelle Duncan\n\"Despite being overlooked for England at any level this season, Chris Rushworth has carried on regardless, doing what he does best, which is taking wickets.\n\"He goes from strength to strength year on year and has again bowled more overs than anyone else in the country - having done the same last year as well.\n\"He's difficult for batsmen to get away because of the way he moves the ball around. And those who think he only gets his wickets at home - think again.\n\"Of his 83 Championship wickets, 41 were taken at Chester-le-Street and 42 away. Those northern wickets, eh?\"\nBy BBC Newcastle's Martin Emmerson\nCompiled by Paul Grunill\n*Statistics correct prior to final round of County Championship fixtures"

The audit report's revelations have been called \"tragic\" and \"embarrassing\" by the French press.\nThe report also criticises choreographer Benjamin Millepied for having a car and a chauffeur, an expense the auditors deemed \"not justified\". Mr Millepied, who is married to Hollywood actor Nathalie Portman, has since left the organisation.\nParis Opera did not respond to requests for an interview. In an interview with Le Parisien, deputy director Jean-Philippe Thiellay, who arrived in August 2014, stopped short of criticising his predecessors but insisted the new management had \"drawn the right conclusions and turned the screw\" on improper practices.\nParis Opera also said it had cut taxi expenses by 30% and restaurant bills by 10% in 2015.\nBut even the new management - under Mr Thiellay and director Stephane Lissner - were reprimanded for spending \u20ac59,900 on the lavish renovation of four offices.\nThe work included a new carpet, paintwork and furniture, according to the audit.\n\"We moved a partition wall and I don't think it's wrong to want to change the carpet,\" Mr Thiellay told Le Parisien.\nThe kerfuffle over expenses at the Paris Opera - which runs two venues, Opera Garnier and Opera Bastille - comes after several other expenses scandals in the French capital:\nThe report said the financial situation of the Opera was \"quite fragile\" despite receiving \u20ac96,751,005 in public subsidies this year, over half of the Opera's total budget."

The 200-plus additions to the software come as it is being investigated by the US road safety regulator.\nA Tesla driver was killed in May when the car he was driving hit a lorry that had been turning left - Autopilot was unable to spot the white trailer against the bright sky.\nNo date has been announced for the conclusion of the investigation, the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration told the BBC.\nIn a call with reporters, Mr Musk said the NHTSA appeared to be \u201chappy\u201d with the Autopilot update.\nMr Musk will hope that the update will appease those critical of Tesla's introduction of the self-driving technology.\nIn July, a consumer rights group in the US accused Tesla of an \u201caggressive rollout of self-driving technology\u201d. It urged Tesla to rename the technology as it felt \u201cautopilot\u201d was \u201cmisleading and dangerous\u201d.\nThe updates to Autopilot, Mr Musk said, will give the car the ability to make greater use of the radar to spot potential dangers.\n\"After careful consideration, we now believe it can be used as a primary control sensor without requiring the camera to confirm visual image recognition,\u201d Mr Musk wrote in a blog post.\nThe challenge in using radar is in avoiding \u201cfalse alarms\u201d, he added, where small objects like cans could be interpreted as a threat.\nOverhead signs or bridges can also be misinterpreted if the road dips. To combat this, Tesla cars are going to be used to \u201clearn\u201d about the road.\n\"Initially, the vehicle fleet will take no action except to note the position of road signs, bridges and other stationary objects, mapping the world according to radar,\u201d Mr Musk wrote.\n\"The car computer will then silently compare when it would have braked to the driver action and upload that to the Tesla database.\n\"If several cars drive safely past a given radar object, whether Autopilot is turned on or off, then that object is added to the geocoded whitelist.\u201d\nTesla did not give a date for the Autopilot update to be rolled out. The radar hardware has been a part of the company\u2019s cars since October 2014.\nFollow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC and on Facebook"

Just because we went to France, it doesn't mean Russia is less important,\" he said.\n\"If you see the film [Don't Take Me Home, the Wales Euro 2016 documentary], it gives you a taste for it again. You want to be back in that environment so I'm desperate to do it again. Desperate. It's the only word I can use.\n\"I'm desperate to go back, be in the middle of that type of pressure. I can't describe to you how that felt. I absolutely want that again. I do. That's all I think about.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nColeman and his players have openly admitted how difficult they found the aftermath of Euro 2016, plunged into an emotional comedown after the searing highs of France.\nThey re-watched goals and games, text messaged each other occasionally - all to try and reproduce the magic of that summer.\nThat is the aim of this World Cup qualifying campaign but, with four points separating Group D leaders Ireland and third-placed Wales, Coleman's men travel to Dublin in need of victory.\nColeman has previously said he would consider his position if Wales were out of contention after five games.\nWith four matches gone, however, he is putting that discussion to one side.\n\"I think until it's mathematically impossible, I'll always, and we've always, got to look at it and go: 'We've got a chance',\" the 46-year-old adds.\n\"So unless we can't finish top and we can't finish second, if that happens, then I'll see how I feel and Wales will see how they feel, I imagine, because it is my last campaign.\"\nWales' match against the Republic of Ireland has the ingredients of a titanic battle - a big and noisy crowd, two teams familiar with each other from countless Premier League skirmishes, and the significance of precious qualifying points to play for.\nThere are echoes of Wales' Euro 2016 group meeting with England - their only defeat in France before losing to Portugal in the semi-finals - and Coleman hopes his team will have learned from their mistakes in Lens.\n\"We went 1-0 up and then we wished our life away, rather than just enjoying those moments,\" he explains.\n\"It's the same for the Republic of Ireland - 50,000 people in the Aviva Stadium, they're top, everyone is billing it as a must-win game for us. But the game will come and go. It only lasts 90 minutes.\n\"The build-up beforehand goes on a lot longer than the game itself. I think you forget sometimes when you're in it that you've got to enjoy it, the players have got to enjoy it on the pitch, and they'll do that if they do what they're good at.\n\"We can't miss the game - we did that I think against England. We were disappointed after the England game because it was a British derby and there was so much surrounding it, and we got sucked into that.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nColeman admits he was crestfallen after the England game, so much so, he broke one of his own rules.\n\"It was a dry camp, we were together seven weeks. No alcohol - staff or players. But I had a double whiskey by myself, a sneaky one out on the balcony,\" he confides.\n\"As a manager you have to look at yourself and I thought I was preaching all the time, don't get sucked into this game to England.\n\"So I was devastated, not because it was England, but we are at a tournament, it is the second game, we had a point in the bag and with four points we were going through really. But we let it slip.\n\"I was absolutely gutted.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nColeman hopes it will be a different story this time.\n\"It's all about us, not worrying about ifs and buts and what happens if we don't do this,\" he says.\n\"It's all about preparation, sticking to our game plan - if the players stick to that and we lose it's my fault. Nine times out of 10 our boys have produced.\n\"We've just got to go into this game not worrying about the outcome. Enjoy it. Meet it. Let's have a right go. It's going to be a great atmosphere.\""

She was born in Georgia in the Caucasus and was \"breastfed by gypsies\".\nBut she is also a passionate believer in the power of Bitcoin and other digital currencies.\nWhen we meet she is busy preparing for an exhibition of sculptures made from the exhausts of former Formula 1 racing cars.\nOne of these strange rib-cage-like creations made from the super-strong alloy inconel has been gold-plated and will sell for about \u00c2\u00a335,000.\n\"These are pieces of history,\" she tells me.\nIn a first for the tradition-bound art world of Cork Street, her international clientele will have the opportunity to pay using Bitcoin, the digital cryptocurrency underpinned by blockchain technology.\nThe gallery will also accept other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Dash, Litecoin, and soon, Monero, she says.\nWhy?\n\"This is not a demand-driven decision at all, it's intuitive based on the way things are going,\" she says.\nShe believes paying by cryptocurrency will become as normal as paying by cash or credit card. She also hopes it will attract a new, non-traditional type of art investor.\nBlockchain, the underlying technology, is a digital ledger or record of transactions that is distributed across, and verified by, thousands of computers in a network.\nOnce the network has reached a consensus that a transaction has happened, the ledger is updated and cannot be tampered with.\n\"Blockchain is a borderless, open source, decentralised peer-to-peer network that governments cannot shut down,\" she says. \"For me, the blockchain is going to be the biggest thing since the internet.\"\nAnd the fact that there is no centralised body - like a bank head office, for example - makes cryptocurrencies safer, she argues, despite their reputation for being volatile, high-risk and the favourite \"store of value\" for criminals and hackers.\nBitcoin payments can be anonymous and potentially beyond the grasp of tax authorities, but this isn't the reason she's offering payment by cryptocurrency, she assures me.\nSo how easy is it to accept a Bitcoin payment?\n\"It's really very simple,\" she explains. \"I give the client my public key [a long string of letters and numbers] and they use that to send bitcoin to my account from their digital wallet or bitcoin exchange,\" she says.\n\"My wallet is linked to my personal bank so I can then convert those bitcoins into pounds, euros or dollars.\"\nMs Dadiani is such a fan of cryptocurrencies - she trades in them as well - that she is launching her own version, Dadicoin, later this year.\nThe $60bn art world in general is warming to the potential of cryptocurrencies, partly because of blockchain's dual ability to establish the provenance of works of art and thereby reduce the reliance on brokers and other middlemen.\nMarcelo Garcia Casil, for example, is chief executive and co-founder of Maecenas, an online marketplace that will enable art owners to sell shares in their expensive works of art (worth more than $1m) and raise money far more cheaply than they could though a bank.\nAnd the owners also get to keep possession of their artworks while sharing up to 49% of the ownership.\nInvestors, who ordinarily wouldn't be able to afford multi-million-dollar works of art, will be able buy shares or units in the work using cryptocurrency. They will then be able to sell these units later in the marketplace. Each transaction is recorded cryptographically on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\"We want to make fine art accessible for everyone,\" says Mr Casil, who was born in Argentina, now lives in Singapore, and has a background in investment banking.\n\"The old auction houses like Christie's and Sotheby's have controlled the art market for centuries, so we think the opportunity for disruption is huge.\"\nEstablishing the authenticity of works of art is critical to their value, and this will still need to be done by skilled professionals, admits Mr Casil.\n\"But once the provenance has been recorded in the blockchain, you never have to do it again,\" he says. This takes a lot of cost out of the system.\nMaecenas has already attracted works of art worth $100m (\u00c2\u00a377m; 86m euros) in total, says Mr Casil, and the marketplace is due for launch in September.\nThe art world has been flirting with Bitcoin for a few years now, despite the likes of auction house Sotheby's saying they have no plans to accept the currency.\nIn April 2015, the Austrian Museum of Applied Art/Contemporary Art (MAK) was the first museum in the world to buy a work of art using Bitcoin.\nDutch artist Harm van den Dorpel created a limited-edition screensaver that was cryptographically authenticated through blockchain.\nAnd online gallery Cointemporary exhibits digital artworks by international contemporary artists that can only be bought with Bitcoin. Purchases are handled by Coinbase, a leading cryptocurrency exchange.\nBlockchain establishes the chain of ownership, preventing anyone from stealing or tampering with the work.\nBut will Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies ever really become a mainstream alternative to traditional money?\nViews differ widely.\nIn Japan, there is a big move to equip 260,000 retail locations with bitcoin capability, and a few high-street retailers, such as Lush, have opted to accept the currency.\nBut Joe Pindar, a director at cyber-security company Gemalto, says: \"At present there are very few businesses accepting bitcoin as a payment method - less than 1% of all retailers.\n\"The biggest barrier to adoption is the length of time it takes to settle a payment in person, with transactions taking tens of minutes.\nDespite this, Mr Pindar says several large retailers have been experimenting with the cryptocurrency, but may choose \"to adopt bitcoin for online purchases only, where time to process a payment is less important.\"\nThe currency's volatility is an issue - the value of one bitcoin topped $3,000 in June, before crashing to below $1,900 in July - and transactions are taking longer and longer to process.\nThis is largely to do with the rules governing how Bitcoin works, and there is currently a big row over how the issue should be resolved.\nIt could be that blockchain proves to be more important to the art world than its flashier Bitcoin offspring."

The alert focused on a $10,000 bracelet from her own range which she had worn during Donald Trump's 60 Minutes interview.\nCritics saw the email as blurring the lines between business and politics.\nThe \"alert\" showed a picture of Ms Trump wearing the bracelet - described as her \"favourite bangle\" - during the CBS interview, which was watched by 20 million people.\nWill Trump's children be his advisers?\nLavish 5bn rupee wedding angers cash-strapped Indians\nWoman finds mouse sewn into new dress\nPeople were quick to accuse her of cashing in on her father's position, while some social media users noted the bracelet's price tag of $10,800 (\u00c2\u00a38,670) - roughly a fifth of the average US annual income  - was at odds with Trump's man of the people image.\nThe Ivanka Trump brand was forced to apologise. Chief brand officer Abigail Klem told The New York Times that the \"style alert\" had been sent by \"a well-intentioned marketing employee at one of our companies who was following customary protocol, and who, like many of us, is still making adjustments post-election\".\nIt is not the first time Ms Trump has used her father's new political career to advertise her own business.\nIn July, Ms Trump raised eyebrows when she plugged a sleeveless sheath dress from her own collection that she wore to the Republican Party's national convention that nominated her father.\nImmediately after the convention, Ms Trump sent a Twitter message with a link directing fans who wanted to \"shop Ivanka's look\" to retailer Macy's website where they could buy the same dress for $138.\nHowever, being the daughter of a controversial candidate has not been entirely good news for the businesswoman.\nThe #grabyourwallets campaign, which calls on women to stop buying Ivanka brand luxury products from major US stores, including Macy's, Nordstrom and Amazon, began after Mr Trump was heard to boast \"you can do anything\" to women \"when you're a star\" and is heard saying \"grab them by the pussy\"."

Her debts are piling up, from health insurance to her daughter's college tuition.\n\"I have bills to pay every month, so I thought getting a job as a maid would be the solution,\" she says.\n\"I don't have formal experience, but I do this sort of work in my own home. So why not?\"\nBrazil is going through its worst recession in more than two decades.\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts the country's economy will have contracted by almost 8% in two years by the end of 2016.\nBrazil soared in the past decade, as one of the emerging Brics economies, when its commodities were hot property in the international markets.\nBut with China slowing down and commodity prices reaching record lows, Brazil's economy went into reverse at high speed last year.\nPresident Dilma Rousseff - from the governing Workers' Party - tried to delay the effects of the recession in the labour market and pumped stimulus money into the economy through tax breaks and subsidies.\nBut now those policies, intended to protect workers, are doing the exact opposite.\nBrazil's debt grew, and the country lost its investment-grade credit rating as well as consumer and investor confidence.\nAnd workers' situations have deteriorated rapidly in the past few months.\nIn just one year, the number of unemployed people jumped 41% - from 6.4 million people to 9.1 million.\nBrazil went from a situation some economists consider full employment, back in early 2014, to 9% unemployment now.\nWages increased in that period, but inflation rose almost twice as fast, so most workers are now worse off.\nA closer look at Brazil's economy reveals some worrying trends.\nDomestic workers are a symbol of that change.\nBrazil is the country with the highest number of domestic workers in the world. Six million people - more than 90% of them women - work as maids.\nA few years ago, when Brazil's economy was flourishing and the country needed workers to fill all the new jobs, women began leaving domestic service to work in industry and shops.\nIn 2011, Brazil's Finance Minister hailed domestic workers as a \"sub-utilised\" labour reserve - an army of women who could gain skills and enter the job market filling better roles, with higher wages.\nAnd that really did happen.\nFrom 2007 until last year, the percentage of people working in domestic jobs fell - from about 8% of Brazil's workforce to below 6%.\nMiddle-income families were left with the choice of either paying higher wages to their maids or doing their own cooking and cleaning.\nBut now there are signs that this trend is in reverse.\nMore women are finding themselves in Mrs Souza's position: losing their jobs in industry and commerce and moving into less skilled jobs with lower wages, many of them returning to roles they thought they had left behind.\nSimone Fernandes spent Brazil's boom years working in a supermarket. She thought her days as a maid were over, but now she is back working for a middle-class family.\n\"Back then things were getting better,\" she says.\n\"You had many job offers. You knew that when you left a job, you'd be quickly employed less than a month later.\n\"Also, you could go to your boss and he would give you counteroffers. But that was then. Now, you have to be happy to just have a job.\"\nDaniele Kuipers, who set up Casa and Cafe, a website that helps maids find jobs, says the number of women offering their services grew a staggering 92% last year, as Brazil's recession deepened.\nBut the demand for domestic servants did not grow.\nMiddle-income families are cutting their expenses because of the crisis too.\nDuring the boom years, Brazil updated its domestic service laws, increasing protection for formal workers.\nThis should have been good news - but, in the current recession, it has only increased costs for hiring maids formally.\nAs a result, Fernando Souza, owner of the Prendas Domesticas job agency, says, there is huge growth in the number of informal domestic workers, who get lower wages and are not collecting their social security payments.\nThis growth in black market jobs is a trend for all workers in Brazil, not just maids. In one year, Brazil lost one million formal jobs.\nBrazil's prolonged recession is having dire consequences for the poorer classes.\nMrs Fernandes and her husband had to sell their car and move into a smaller flat.\nThey are working longer hours - but, with prices rising on a monthly basis, their standard of living is declining rapidly.\nThere may be one silver lining, though, for some of these families who were emerging socially but are now sinking again.\nDuring Brazil's good years, both Mrs Souza and Mrs Fernandes managed to get their children through college.\nThat means the next generation of workers may be more skilled than the current one.\nBrazil's challenge for the future will be to create new skilled jobs for them.\nAdditional reporting by Ruth Costas, BBC Brasil."

It does not feature directly on the World Anti-Doping Agency's (Wada) prohibited list, but is banned depending on the strength of the dose used.\nKuyt, who retired from football in May, used dexamethasone, apparently for pain relief because of tooth problems.\nGermany international Mario Gomez needed salbutamol, which is a common asthma medication.\nEx-New Zealand, Blackburn and QPR defender Ryan Nelsen, who is listed as 'Nelson' on the published form, declared the use of prednisone, another corticosteroid.\nThere were no England players among the 25 names released by Fancy Bears.\nA TUE allows an athlete, for medical reasons, to take a prescribed substance or have treatment that is otherwise prohibited.\nAthletes must contact their national governing body before applying for a TUE.\nThere are strict criteria for one to be granted:\nUkad says it has \"a number of robust controls in place to make it as difficult as possible\" for athletes to misuse the system.\nFancy Bears first hacked the Wada database last year, and in September began revealing athletes' confidential details and information regarding TUEs.\nBritish cyclist Sir Bradley Wiggins was forced to defend himself in the face of scrutiny following the leak of his medical records.\nThe IAAF - athletics' world governing body - then said in April it was hacked by the group earlier this year.\nMo Farah, Helen Glover and Justin Rose were among the British athletes who had their medical files made public.\nBBC Sport's David Ornstein\nIt was inevitable that Fancy Bears would eventually target the world's biggest sport, perhaps the only surprise being that it took so long.\nThe statement on the Fancy Bears' website promises to prove that players and officials are \"lying\" when they \"unanimously affirm\" that football is free of doping.\nBut, while concerning, this release is not exactly earth-shattering.\nThere is no suggestion that any of the World Cup TUEs involve wrongdoing - but it may reignite the debate about whether the system can be abused."

But there's no good reason why it wouldn't happen.\"\nPresident Obama's pledge to close the high-security prison camp in Cuba is the primary reason behind Mr Aamer's likely release, Mr Stafford Smith said.\n\"And he can't do that unless he gets rid of the 57 people who have been cleared at least - and Shaker has been cleared for eight years now.\n\"But it's also down to the incredibly good work by so many people, like Andrew Mitchell who visited the US with three other MPs. I have letter here with me from Shaker where he's incredibly grateful for that. So many people have done so many great things to help him and I think that's had a great impact.\"\nMr Aamer was detained in Kabul, Afghanistan in 2001. US authorities allege he had led a unit of Taliban fighters and had met former al-Qaeda leader, Osama Bin Laden.\nBut Mr Aamer has maintained he was in Afghanistan with his family doing charity work.\nThe Saudi national has permission to live in the UK indefinitely because his wife is a British national. They have four children and live in London - he has never met his youngest child.\nMr Stafford Smith explained: \"In Shaker's case, the proof in the pudding is that he was cleared by the Bush administration and cleared by the Obama administration. So if they clear him and all six of the national security agencies say he should be released, then it's quite hard to make the argument that he's guilty of something.\n\"The world is insane. I go to Guantanamo and see a place where still half of the prisoners who are there have been cleared for release. What other prison is there in the world where 50% of the prisoners are told 'you're free to go but you can't go.\"\nEarlier this month, four cross-party MPs - former international development secretary Andrew Mitchell, Jeremy Corbyn, David Davis and Andy Slaughter - met senior officials in Washington to try and secure Mr Aamer's release.\n\"We're hopeful we advanced the case. We spoke to a number of senior senators who were as perplexed as we are about why it was taking so long for him to be released for transfer back to the United Kingdom,\" Mr Mitchell told Victoria Derbyshire.\n\"Our prime minister asked for him to be transferred earlier this year on his visit to the United States and it is incomprehensible that the United States would treat its oldest ally and staunchest friend in this very cavalier way.\"\nIn a statement the Foreign Office said it continued to raise Mr Aamer's case \"at the highest levels\".\n\"The US authorities have now prioritised this case for review and we welcome President Obama's continuing commitment to closing the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay,\" it added.\nWatch  Victoria Derbyshire on weekdays from 09:15-11:00 BST on BBC Two and BBC News Channel.

Bad Wolf said it would be paying back the loan with interest.\nThe company, which was set up in 2015 by former BBC executives Julie Gardner and Jane Tranter and is based in south Wales and Los Angeles, is currently working on two series, A Discovery Of Witches and His Dark Materials.\nAccounts for July 2015 to December 2016 show the Welsh Government gave the firm a loan worth just under \u00a34m.\nThe documents says that Ms Tranter received \u00a3855,417 while Ms Gardner was given \u00a3519,301. A third director, Miles Ketley, received \u00a3441,539.  He resigned from the company in March 2017.\nPart of Ms Tranter's pay - \u00a3300,000 - was earmarked for relocation expenses. She was also given a loan of \u00a3270,645.  At the end of 2016 \u00a3186,861 of the loan was still owing.\nThe accounts state that the firm achieved a turnover of \u00a31.8m and a gross profit of \u00a3519,941, but after administrative expenses of \u00a33.7m it made a loss of \u00a33.1m.\nMs Davies, the Welsh Conservative's culture spokeswoman, said while the party hopes that Bad Wolf and its pipeline projects will achieve great success, \"there are aspects of its finances which are concerning\".\nShe said it was \"curious\" why the Welsh Government loan was guaranteed against the value of the company's assets, which she said the report showed \"are worth a mere fraction relative to the loan's value\".\n\"That the three directors are collectively paying themselves an annual income equivalent to nearly half of loan's value is also a cause for concern - especially given that their projects are still in the inchoate stages and are yet to make a return,\" she said.\n\"The Welsh Government's less-than-stellar record on investment decisions has been well-publicised, and taxpayers will rightly be questioning how ministers have found themselves in this position yet again - especially in a sector where Wales is working hard to promote a strong international offer.\"\nA spokesman for Bad Wolf said: \"Welsh Government loaned \u00a34 million to Bad Wolf to launch a business that would develop international TV production in Wales - to be repaid with interest.\n\"Since then Bad Wolf has brought in over double that amount in investment from outside companies with further investment from HBO and Sky being announced [on Wednesday].\n\"The company has just unveiled a new \u00a325m production to be shot in Cardiff - A Discovery Of Witches for Sky 1 - meaning that the loan from Welsh Government has already generated significant new business and new jobs for Wales with more projects to follow in 2018 and beyond.\"\nA Welsh Government spokesman said it no comment \"on a commercial decision by a private company\"."

We don't have a policy of segregating pupils in the classroom,\" he said.\nAnd Mr Alam denied claims there had been assemblies with speakers sympathetic to Al-Qaeda.\nPressed on whether he believed pupils should be able to swim in the month of Ramadan, he said there were concerns that swallowing water would mean breaking a fast.\nA pupil at Park View School, Tahira Mohammed, who is about to take her GCSEs, told BBC WM that the dispute was creating unwanted pressure during the exam season.\n\"To be honest, it's added pressure and unwanted pressure to me and my fellow pupils. I just feel that all of this going on is completely unnecessary, it's extra stress and we've got exams - it could affect our future.\"\nThe investigations into extremism in Birmingham schools had been sparked by an anonymous and unverified letter claiming that there was a \"Trojan Horse\" conspiracy by a group wanting to impose a more hardline Muslim agenda on schools in the city.\nThis included claims that head teachers were being replaced with staff who were more likely to be sympathetic to these religious beliefs.\nThe authenticity of the letter has been disputed, but the National Association of Head Teachers says there seemed to have been \"concerted efforts\" to take over six schools in Birmingham.\nThe education watchdog for England, Ofsted, is to publish inspection reports next month into schools where there have been allegations.\nThe Department for Education has commissioned an investigation headed by former counter-terror chief, Peter Clarke."

She fired a Desert Eagle handgun from close range, as he held an encyclopaedia in front of his chest.\nHe had experimented previously and thought the thick book would protect him, but the couple's three-year-old child and nearly 30 onlookers watched as she fired a fatal bullet.\nSince YouTube launched in 2005, it has attracted people willing to do things on camera for a slice of minor online fame.\nBut in 2012, the company made it easier for contributors to obtain a chunk of the advertising revenue they generate from videos. Studios were created and grants given out to groom a stable of stars who need to make fresh, compelling content to keep the clicks - and advertising dollars - rolling in.\nThey are often media personalities in their own right, with agents and slickly produced videos.\nHundreds of thousands of others, like the Minnesota couple, sit below them and are trying to gather followings. Many have little success.\nBut the rewards of becoming one of the few who make it big can be a huge motivation to keep trying. (According to Forbes, the top 12 highest-earning YouTube stars made a combined $70.5m from June 2015 - June 2016.)\nAnd while stunts are merely one genre of an extremely diverse landscape of videos made by YouTubers - from cooking to comedy and music to beauty - they do get millions of views.\nDr Arthur Cassidy, a British psychologist specialising in social media, says videos of dangerous stunts can inspire teenage copycats who \"haven't got the cognitive function to figure out this could be very fatal\".\n\"It's perceived as being 'fun' or 'exciting' or 'high-risk'. Anything that is high risk is intriguing, gets adrenaline going and sets up highly competitive game playing within the fraternity of late adolescence.\"\nBut what the Minnesota couple tried to film is \"one of the most horrific cases\" he has come across.\nFears that young people watching from home could try it, but with a less powerful weapon to see if it could work, are \"salient and highly profound\", Dr Cassidy says.\nDoing dangerous things for online attention is nothing new.\nIn 2011, Australian Acton Beale fell to his death after trying to \"plank\" on the balcony of a seventh floor flat in Brisbane.\nThe planking craze - which involved people lying down straight-bodied in unusual, but mostly safe, places - was largely confined to still images uploaded to Facebook.\nBut the Australian case signalled how a growing internet \"stunt\" culture for attention could lead to tragedy, and since then several online trends have reportedly caused deaths worldwide.\nOf course, YouTube has no borders, and stunt videos from anywhere can go viral globally.\nRussia's Interior Ministry recently launched a \"safe selfie\" campaign in response to a growing local culture of amateur daredevils filming their stunts.\nIn one video watched by millions of people, Alexander Chernikov lights his trousers on fire and jumps off a nine-storey building into the snow.\nThese kinds of stunts make the antics of TV pranksters from a pre-YouTube era, like those of the MTV reality show Jackass, seem tame.\nCritics say that YouTube, owned by Google, needs to do more to take down videos of extremely dangerous stunts.\nThe company said it was \"horrified to learn of the tragedy in Minnesota\" and that its thoughts were with the family. No video of the incident is believed to have been uploaded.\nA spokesperson told the BBC that it removes content flagged by users that breaks its rules.\nIts policy on harmful and dangerous content says it draws the line at content \"that intends to incite violence or encourage dangerous or illegal activities that have an inherent risk of serious physical harm or death\".\nExamples of what would be banned include videos depicting \"bomb making, choking games, hard drug use, or other acts where serious injury may result\"."

We've got a small instrument on the back seat of our car. We just suck in the air at the front of our car, taking in this plume from the vehicle in front, and get some values.\"\nGPS tracks the location. A camera identifies the type of vehicle -  motorcycle, car, lorry or bus - and the manufacturer.\nThe team is particularly interested in oxides of nitrogen, which are produced in the combustion process and can be a serious health hazard.\nFor two years, the Heidelberg scientists have been chasing motor vehicles through the streets of a number of Germany towns, with some often quite surprising results.\nThey have seen a lot of variability in emissions.\nYes, the newest models had, by and large, the cleanest plumes, but this was not always so.\nThe group would often come across high-polluting vehicles that had been built to comply with the very latest emissions standards (and before you ask: these were not all VWs).\nThis may indicate faults in the systems installed in these vehicles to clean up tailpipe gases.\nTypically, many of the worst offenders were buses, in particular some older models.\nBizarrely, one of the buses in Mainz producing very high concentrations of nitrogen dioxide was emblazoned with a campaign urging people to get onboard in order to lower emissions.\nOne clear message, however, does seem to come out of the research: a relatively small number of vehicles on the road is responsible for a high fraction of total emissions.\nIn the case of Mainz, the plumes of 7.6% of vehicles contained more than 500 parts per billion by volume (about 1,000 microgram per cubic metre) of nitrogen dioxide (NO2). But if you could somehow take just these vehicles off the road, you would reduce emissions by 45%.\n\"So if you exclude only these high emitters, you have a big impact on air quality,\" explained Dr P\u00c3\u00b6hler from Heidelberg's Institute of Environmental Physics.\n\"If you were to do the same just with old cars, you would have a much smaller impact. It is really important that we focus on the small number of vehicles with very high concentrations.\""

Wholesale electricity costs make up just under half of household electricity bills.\nThe heatwave hitting the south of England means air conditioning units are being turned up.\nDemand is higher than average for September and at its highest since April, when a cold snap and snow storms led to severe weather warnings in parts of the UK.\nThe unseasonal September weather has also reduced wind power in the system.\nAnd adding to the pressure, the number of gas power stations that have been shut down for planned maintenance is at its highest level since 2009.\nUnplanned outages at other stations have compounded the problem.\nGlenn Rickson, head of power analysis at Platts, said: \"It seems to be the straw that broke the camel's back this week.\"\nThe surprise rise in demand and a drop in supply has left the UK with less spare power than usual. It comes after concerns about spare capacity going into winter.\nUsually extra electricity can be drawn in from a connection between the UK's grid and the French network, but the crucial cable is not working properly, limiting transfers.\nIn France, several nuclear power stations are also offline, meaning there is less electricity for the French to sell to the UK.\nNick Grogan, an energy industry analyst, said it was \"almost the perfect storm\".\nHe added: \"The price tells you suppliers are looking at the market and saying: 'Is there enough power there?'\n\"It's rare for it to get this bad.\"\nNational Grid admitted the UK's electricity supply was \"a little tight\" but said it was \"completely manageable\".\nThe operator said it was comfortable it had enough power in reserve to keep the lights on.\nFactories have not been asked to reduce demands on the grid and emergency generating capacity has not been called on.\nIn a statement it said: \"Electricity demand is picking up as we head into autumn, and some power stations are still offline for their summer maintenance programme, which is not unusual at this time of year.\n\"We are monitoring the situation and have tools and services we can call on if we need them.\""

According to an official release, the Gambian leader will now be known formally as \"His Excellency Sheikh Professor Alhaji Dr Yahya AJJ Jammeh Babili Mansa\".\nBabili Mansa, we are told, means Bridge Builder, or Conqueror of Rivers, in the Mandika language. Since the figurative building of bridges or making peace is not one of President Jammeh's known characteristics, I take it that it is more the Conqueror of Rivers that the new title of Babili Mansa is meant to indicate.\nThe President of the Republic of the Gambia, Commander in Chief, Sheikh, Professor Alhaji Dr etc etc Yahya AJJ Jammeh might think he is treading new ground; but unfortunately, we have seen it all before.\nThe practice of acquiring a long list of titles started with our earliest presidents as soon as independence came.\nThat, after all, is how our traditional chiefs are addressed and the new presidents saw themselves as big chiefs - that probably explains why they couldn't come to terms with term limits and wanted to be presidents for life.\nExactly why the title of \"Dr\" had to be an obligatory part of that list, I haven't worked out.\nGhana was the first sub-Saharan country to gain independence and our first president got himself suitably impressive titles, with the obligatory unearned \"Dr\" and with that started the practice.\nHe was addressed: Osagyefo, (a chief's title, said to mean Redeemer) Dr Kwame Nkrumah - Life President of the Republic of Ghana. The Life President bit was aborted when he was overthrown in a coup d'etat.\nThe sergeant-major-turned-president of Zaire, now Democratic Republic of Congo, Joseph Mobutu, took the trend a scale higher. He became Mobutu Sese Seko Kuku Ngbendu Waza Banga, meaning The Warrior who Goes from Conquest to Conquest Leaving Fire in his Wake.\nThose of us of a certain age can recall that there used to be His Excellency the President, Ngwazi Dr Hastings Kamuzu Banda-Life President of the Republic of Malawi. If you missed out a comma, you got into serious trouble.\nAgain, the Life President bit turned out to have been over-optimistic because he was forced out of State House before he died.\nThen of course there was a certain embarrassment in Uganda; he had to be called: Field Marshall Dr Idi Amin Dada MC DSO CBE (Conqueror of the British Empire)-Life President of Uganda.\nOnce more, the Life President bit turned out to have been optimistic and he was chased out, much to the relief of everybody in 1979.\nIn Zimbabwe, state TV refers to: His Excellency, The President, Robert Gabriel Mugabe and Commander-in-Chief of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces.\nBut at social events, ministers often add: Patron of War Veterans, First Secretary of the Party and Chancellor of State Universities.\nAnd even: Supreme Leader, First Citizen of the Nation, Honorary Black Belt and Professor of Diplomacy.\nHe remains in post at the age of 91 and continues to befuddle all his opponents.\nThe obsession with titles as I have pondered in  previous columns, is not reserved for only our leaders, it seems to be an African disease. Or so I thought until a friend of mine pointed out to me recently that it is not unlikely that it is something that we inherited from the British colonialists.\nIndeed who else has all these Sirs, Dukes, Duchess, Baroness, Viscounts, OBEs, CBEs etc etc? We have probably simply been trying to emulate them.\nThe official full title of the Head of State from which we got our independence is: Her Majesty, \"Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of Her other Realms and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith\".\nTry matching that! The Bridge Builder or even Conqueror of Rivers doesn't quite have the same ring to it.\nMore from Elizabeth Ohene:\nBritain's speedy high-drama elections seen through Ghanaian eyes\nShould Ghanaians be given a three-day-weekend to attend funerals?\nTaking advantage of a crisis\nTolerating fufu made in a microwave"

The decision to assign some of the existing police officers to provide security for VIPs and their families further depletes the capacity of the force to provide security for all.\nBut some Nigerians believe the president's decision to recruit more officers could be a beginning of a total reform of the police force as the president also promised more training and focused on human rights.\nPresident Buhari told a police security summit in the capital, Abuja, on Monday that a federal anti-terrorism agency would be established to deal with future conflicts.\nHe said that the government would also train and equip police to address the challenges facing the country.\nBut he urged the officers to respect human rights and other international conventions in carrying out their duties.\nRights groups have accused Nigerian police of human rights abuses and corruption - allegations they deny.\nNigeria insecurity:\nThe president did not say when the recruitment would start.\nApart from the Boko Haram insurgency, Nigeria's security is also being threatened by ethnic conflict mostly between Fulani herdsmen and farmers in central part of the country.\nPolice are also struggling to cope with kidnappings and armed robbery in the south."

Mobile systems like the RS-24 Yars or Topol (there is also a silo-based version) are seen as essential to providing a retaliatory capability.\nAt a time of crisis they would emerge from their bases and be deployed to pre-surveyed sites.\nNato suspended co-operation with Russia after it took over and annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and relations remain frosty.\nBoth sides have staged military exercises and Nato is to beef up its forces to reassure the Baltic states and Poland. The election of Donald Trump to the US presidency has also triggered alarm, as he is widely seen as more friendly to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nRussia deployed nuclear-capable Iskander missiles two months ago in Kaliningrad, an enclave that borders Poland and Lithuania. Mr Putin said last month that Russia had to use its missile systems as \"counter-measures\" against facilities it saw as threatening.\nUnconfirmed reports have also suggested that Russia has been looking into transporting its Yars missiles by rail.\nThe chief of Russia's General Staff, Valery Gerasimov, told foreign military attaches in Moscow on Thursday that the idea that Russia's armed build-up in the west was a threat to Nato was \"totally groundless\".\nWhile Russia's forces in its western military district had decreased, he argued, Nato's activities had been stepped up."

Clean lines, geometric shapes and abstracted details appeal to judges brought up on a strict diet of Frank Lloyd Wright and Le Corbusier.\nNothing wrong with that per se: there is beauty in architectural simplicity - as demonstrated by the ancient Greeks, Palladio and more recently by the likes of Oscar Niemeyer and Sir David Chipperfield.\nBut, as we know, variety is the spice of life. Which makes this list's lack of anything outr\u00c3\u00a9 a tad dull. Where are the New Romantics, the neo-Goths or assimilators of non-western aesthetics into the contemporary architecture of multi-cultural Britain?\nThat said, all six buildings are welcome additions to the UK's landscape, a natural canvas that is too often blighted by truly awful buildings that are hopeless in every sense.\nWe know the winner will come from the modernist school, but not which of the six. I think it should go to the building that most successfully obeys the rule Louis Sullivan - a founding father of modernist architecture - established in his essay The Tall Office Building Artistically Considered (1896), in which he famously wrote: \"Form ever follows function.\"\nHousing features prominently on this year's list, with two of the contenders offering a different approach to new-build development.\n\"The Riba Stirling Prize is awarded to the building that has made the biggest contribution to the evolution of architecture, and nowhere is the need for fresh-thinking needed more than in housing,\" Riba president Angela Brady said.\n\"The UK is blighted with unimaginative, poor quality houses that people don't want to live in but have little other choice, so I am delighted to see two amazing and highly original housing projects on this year's shortlist.\n\"They shine a light on what the future of UK housing can be,\" she added.\nFive of the six architects feature for the first time, beating off competition from previous winners Sir David Chipperfield and Dame Zaha Hadid.\nIt is also the first time in the prize's 18-year history that as many as half of the shortlisted firms have women at the helm.\nThe prize is given to Riba-chartered architects and international fellows of the institute for their work on a building in the UK. Buildings by Riba-chartered architects in the EU are also eligible.\nThe six shortlisted buildings vary in size and purpose, but all will be judged by the same criteria: Their design excellence and their significance to the evolution of architecture and the built environment. They are:\nPart of one of the UK's most iconic and infamous housing estates and famous for walkways known as \"streets in the sky\", Park Hill was built in 1961 and was one of the first Brutalist buildings in the UK. Inspired by Le Corbusier's Unite D'habitation, a famous block of flats in Marseille, France, the building divided opinion between some who loved it and many who loathed it. By the 1980s Park Hill had become dilapidated and was no longer a popular place to live. Poor noise insulation, badly lit walkways and plenty of passages and alleys made perfect getaways for muggers.\nArchitects Hawkins Brown and Studio Egret West have kept the structure of the building in place but changed key features, such as interior layout, windows and security. The \"streets in the sky\" remain, but the external brickwork has been replaced with bright coloured aluminium. A new window in each flat that faces the street has been described as an improvement to the design by the original architect. Judges said the reinvented building \"stands as a beacon for imaginative regeneration, quality mass housing and the bold reuse of a listed building\".\nPark Hill, beauty or beast? Listen to Angela Brady, president of Riba, and Sir Simon Jenkins, chairman of the National Trust, debate.\nEstablished in 1972 and given formal recognition in 1989, University of Limerick was the first new university to be created since Irish Independence in 1922. The medical school is a collection of buildings, which were required to complement each other forming a public square on the campus located along the River Shannon. Designed by Ireland-based firm Grafton Architects, the project was completed on a \"rock bottom budget\".\nIt includes the medical faculty, two accommodation blocks and a bus shelter, designed to represent a gateway to the monolithic medical school, which is a three-storey cliff-like building constructed using local blue limestone. Lots of natural light and ventilation flood the internal space and judges said the project \"feels like it punches well above its weight\". \"It transforms simple teaching and study spaces into rich, theatrical spaces, with a generosity that verges on the heroic.\"\nRiba Stirling Prize\nRoyal Institute of British Architects\nLocated in Harlow, Essex, Newhall Be housing development is a reconfiguration of the traditional terraced house. A mix of apartments, villas, courtyard and terraced houses, architect Alison Brooks' design of 84 dwellings takes inspiration from the traditional Essex barns and the sculptures of Romanian born artist, Brancusi.\nConventional gardens have been replaced by balconies, patios and roof decks, acting as extensions to the living space while capturing sunlight at various times of the day. The angled buildings also feature a high, cathedral-style roof, which can be converted into another bedroom, and have been designed to avoid overlooking by neighbours. Judges said the scheme \"raises the bar for suburban developments\" adding that if used elsewhere, it could have a \"significant impact\" on development in the UK. \"In the context of much of the UK's new house building it is truly exceptional.\" Brooks won the Stirling Prize in 2008 for her part in the Accordia development in Cambridge.\nServing two groups - Ripon theological college community and a small religious order, the Sisters of Begbroke - the Grade II listed Bishop Edward King Chapel in Cuddleston was praised by judges for being an \"exquisite piece of design and craftsmanship\". The brief for Niall McLaughlin Architects was to design an uplifting spiritual space of great potency within an extremely small area.\nMr McLaughlin described the starting point of the project as the word, nave, which describes the central space of a church but also shares the same origin as navis, a ship. \"From these words, two architectural images emerged. The first is the hollow in the ground as the meeting place of the community, the still centre. The second is the delicate ship-like timber structure that floats above in the tree canopy, the gathering place for light and sound.\" Above a fine stone or ashlar base, the building has been constructed using mainly cream limestone, which has been hand broken and laid criss-cross with the unfinished, raw ends exposed to produce a rich texture. The delicate structure is made from blonde wood while windows allow light to flood the chapel and its ambulatory with even, natural light.\nDescribed by judges as a \"highly imaginative and sculptural piece of land art,\" visitors to the centre are given a physical and interactive experience, just like the Giants Causeway it overlooks. Dublin-based Heneghan Peng were selected from 800 entries to design the centre, which was to be both sympathetic to its rugged coastal surroundings including a Unesco World Heritage Site and and Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Composed from two folds marked into the ground, rising up to 6m in height, one rises up to accommodate the building while the second folds down to shield a car park from view.\nWindows between columns made from locally quarried, dark coloured volcanic rock - the same material as the causeway - allow visitors to be aware of the outside despite the building being partially underground. \"This one pulls off that difficult trick of being a destination in its own right without upstaging the principal event - the causeway which is set a kilometre apart and invisible from it,\" commented judges.\nDating back to the 12th Century, Astley Castle became a Grade II listed building in 1951. It was converted into a hotel in 1955 but a fire in 1978 left as a ruin. A full restoration of the building was not possible, so the task for Architects Witherford Watson Man was to install a new house within the stabilised ruins. With the aim of adding to the many historical layers of the building, courts and outdoor rooms are formed by both old and new walls, while contemporary materials have been colour matched to the original palette.\nThe layout of the house, which is designed to accommodate up to eight people, is inverted with bedrooms and bathrooms on the ground floor and the living quarters on the first floor. With its deep-set windows and multiple vistas, it is a solid and practical building. Judges described the house as \"a hybrid, grafted thing, whose spaces are made of elements varying between one and 800 years old, acting together\"."

Despite the Bible and a love of scriptures, the world at large will watch us die in leaking boats in the Mediterranean or killed while crossing deserts as we demonstrate for the right to stay in places like Israel and Saudi Arabia where we are not wanted.\nOne thing you can be sure of is that 2014 will come and go of its own accord regardless of the prophecies - and it may well be more of the same but not necessarily in that order.\nIf you would like to comment on Farai Sevenzo's column, please do so below."

That's the motivation now for us all.\n\"I'd like to apologise for my reaction last night, something that should never be shown publicly on the field.\"\nStriker Leigh Griffiths revealed on Friday that Commons had apologised to the rest of the squad.\nManager Ronnie Deila would not confirm if the former Scotland player would be disciplined but, when asked if Commons would be available for selection against Dundee United on Sunday, the Norwegian said: \"Yeah, of course.\n\"It's very important [that Commons apologised] and I'm happy for that,\" said Deila. \"He came to me and did it at once and that's very good. We have dealt with it and now we have to move on.\n\"We have to have discipline and stay together and he really understands that.\n\"I've had many of these situations before - it's not the first time. Different sorts of situations as well.\n\"I'm confident that I have a good relationship with the players. Everybody's disappointed. We have to speak through things and get better.\"\nDeila was also asked about the supporters' frustrations following the loss in Norway, which left Celtic bottom of Europa League Group A on two points - five behind leaders Molde.\n\"I understand they're angry,\" he said\n\"I really understand and I know a lot of people are travelling around with Celtic and have big expectations. We are very, very sorry and disappointed.\n\"We have to move on and make it good again and that starts on Sunday.\n\"You will lose football games. This time it was a bad performance, that's why it's even worse to lose. We have to get back on a good performance and the only thing we can do is look forward and do it on Sunday.\n\"I really believe in what we're doing. The situation is not unbelievably bad. We are top of the league, we are still in both cups, we still have a chance in Europe so there are some positive things.\""

That's certainly the view of Dave Frymier, chief information security officer at Unisys, a Pennsylvania-based IT company.\nBut he believes the driving force for this will be different: not government surveillance programmes, but the threat of attacks from hackers.\nRather than encrypting everything, Mr Frymier advocates that companies identify what he believes is the 5%-15% of their data that is really confidential, and use encryption to protect just that.\nHe says employees should then be barred from accessing this data using standard desktop and laptop machines or their own smartphones or tablets, which can easily be infected with malware. Access would be restricted to employees using secure \"hardened\" computers.\n\"When you look at the increasing sophistication of malware, it becomes apparent that you need to establish highly protected enclaves of data. The only way to achieve that is through modern encryption, properly implemented,\" says Mr Frymier.\n\"You can split your data into diamonds and paperclips, and the important thing is to encrypt the diamonds, and not to sweat the paperclips.\"\nPrakash Panjwani, a general manager at Maryland-based data protection company Safenet, also believes that the large number of high-profile data breaches in 2013 - including hacker attacks on US retailer Target, software maker Adobe, and photo messaging service Snapchat - means that 2014 will inevitably be a bumper one for encryption vendors.\n\"Snowden has focused attention on surveillance issues, but the real threat is organised crime and the number of data breaches that are occurring,\" he says.\n\"Companies are going to come under extreme pressure from boards, customers and regulators in 2014 to take action so that if there is a data breach they can say, 'We didn't lose any data because it was encrypted.'\"\nA large number of companies already use encryption to protect the data they store on their own systems \"at rest\", as well as data \"in flight\" as it is sent over networks to customers, other data centres, or for processing or storage in the cloud.\nBut Ramon Krikken, an analyst at Gartner, believes that the way encryption is used by many of these companies is likely to change in 2014.\n\"Companies are certainly going to have to take encryption more seriously thanks to the Snowden revelations,\" he says.\n\"At the moment many companies are using encryption for compliance reasons, not for security. They are not using it to protect their data, but because it is the easiest way to comply with regulations: encryption is the auditor's and the regulator's favourite check box item.\"\nOne question that companies will need to consider is which encryption algorithm or cipher to use to best encrypt their data. It's an important question as some older ciphers can now be \"cracked\" relatively quickly using the computing power in a standard desktop PC.\nAnd there is a question mark over whether the NSA may have deliberately used its influence to weaken some encryption systems - or even to introduce \"back doors\" that provide easy access to encrypted data to anyone who knows of their existence.\n\"The problem is that even if you can inspect the source code, it is certainly not a given that you would be able to spot a back door,\" Mr Krikken says.\nHe believes it is more important to establish where all the parts of an encryption solution come from.\n\"If you procure software or hardware from overseas, from a country with a government which does not have your best interests at heart, you need to remember that it may not be as secure as you think,\" Mr Krikken says.\n\"So you have to decide who you trust, and find out where the vendor gets all the parts of its product from.\"\nAnother thing companies need to consider when they implement encryption is how strong the encryption should be. Using a longer encryption key makes it harder for hackers or governments to crack the encryption, but it also requires more computing power.\nBut Robert Former, senior security consultant for Neohapsis, an Illinois-based security services company, says many companies are overestimating the computational complexity of encryption.\n\"If you have an Apple Mac, your processor spends far more time making OS X looks pretty than it does doing crypto work.\"\nHe therefore recommends using encryption keys that are two or even four times longer than the ones many companies are currently using.\n\"I say use the strongest cryptography that your hardware and software can support. I guarantee you that the cost of using your available processing power is less than the cost of losing your data because you were too cheap to make the crypto strong enough,\" he says.\n\"No-one ever got fired for having encryption that was too strong.\""

Nicky was an exemplar of a person who acted when something needed to be done.\n\"It's very emotional and very moving to be here. It feels very important to be here with my extended family.\"\nOne of the Kindertransport children, Hana Isaac-Kleiner, now 88, told the BBC that Nicholas Winton saved their lives.\nShe said: \"He was one of the few on the team in Prague who were well-enough informed about what was happening in Germany and Austria to realise that the danger to Jewish people was imminent.\"\nAnother, Kurt Taussig, 92, from Stanmore, Harrow, said he usually did not come to Kindertransport events but would have \"swum an ocean to be here\".\n\"What that man did has never been done before or again. He was completely unique in achieving a miracle.\"\nMr Taussig spent seven years in the RAF after coming over on the Kindertransport.\nHow did one Englishman save 669 children from the Holocaust?\nOthers present at the service included Lord Alfred Dubs, Lady Milena Grenfell-Baines and the Rev John Fieldsend, who were all part of the Kindertransport, as well as representatives from the German and Swedish embassies.\nThe service also had contributions from Lord Dubs and former Czech ambassador Michael Zantovsky.\nAsked what message people should take from Sir Nicholas's life, Lord Dubs said: \"I think what they should see is the story the triumph of the human spirit where one individual said he is going to do something and save lives from the Holocaust and he did it.\"\nSir Nicholas continued community work in later life in Maidenhead, Berkshire.\nHis surviving children Nick and Barbara Winton speak at events around the world about how one person can change lives.\nBarbara Winton wrote his biography If It's Not Impossible, the title of which is taken from his motto: \"If something is not impossible there must be a way of doing it.\"\nA separate memorial concert is to take place on Friday at St John's Smith Square in central London, including readings by actors Jason Isaacs and Rupert Graves and music from cellist Alexander Baillie, raising funds for current child refugees."

There is a degree of pressure on Edwards to get it right this time.\nVisual effects specialist Edwards, 38, was chosen for Godzilla after he blew critics away with his 2010 debut movie Monsters, made on a micro-budget of about \u00c2\u00a3500,000 and edited at his London home.\nHaving directed, written and orchestrated the special effects, Edwards won best director at the 2011 British Independent Film Awards.\nThree years later and armed with a budget of millions, Edwards said despite hankering to make \"just one\" Godzilla special effect shot, he \"didn't even get a spare five minutes\".\n\"But the beauty of it is that I was surrounded with the best of the best,\" he said. \"The visual effects supervisor was Jim Rygiel who did The Lord of the Rings and we also had John Dykstra, who did the original Star Wars movie.\n\"Working with genuine heroes of mine, handing your baby over to people who can look after it way better than you can, is an easy thing,\" he added, although he admitted \"this film is the hardest thing I've ever had to do\".\nEdwards employed the skills of actor Andy Serkis - who has previously used performance capture to create characters such as Gollum in the Lord of the Rings films and King Kong - to help create Godzilla's movements on screen.\nThe director said Serkis \"helped shape the title character's emotional arc\" and was key for Godzilla's facial expressions. The director and his team also studied the faces of dogs and bears while developing the monster's head, which incorporated \"the nobility of an eagle\".\nAmong the human characters battling the monsters and the elements is Breaking Bad TV star Cranston, who plays a nuclear scientist and whistleblower.\nAfter his Emmy and Golden Globe-winning performance in the TV drama, he said he knew his next role would be \"compared\" and wanted it to be \"of extremely high quality as far as the writing is concerned\".\nGodzilla ticked all the boxes for him and he said he liked the film's emotional content and focus on relationships and family.\n\"When the offer came in to do Godzilla, at first I thought 'Oh, I probably shouldn't do it, no', and my agent said: 'You might want to take a look at this because it's very different'.\n\"I was like 'Wow, this is fantastic', and then you have this monster movie and I loved Godzilla - he was my favourite monster. I like to keep surprising people.\"\nTaylor-Johnson, who plays his army lieutenant son who battles to return to his family, also liked the focus on relationships.\n\"I liked the fact that he was a father and a husband and [the film] had a real strong family element to it, and that it became a fight for survival he had to try and get through in order to reach his family,\" he said.\nOlsen, who plays Taylor-Johnson's on-screen wife, said she enjoyed the challenge of playing a mother who has to \"figure out how to go through things that are scary but not let on\" because her son is witnessing the devastation around him.\nCranston said ultimately it would be the fans who determine if the film is a success. Some have already criticised Godzilla for being \"too fat\" but the actor said he had to \"hope for the best\".\n\"It's the public - the fans - that create a classic film or TV show,\" he added.\n\"So it's up to them to decide if it weathers the test of time. And so too will it be for this version of our film.\"\nGodzilla opens in UK cinemas on 15 May."

What next, for the government and for Parliament? How would MPs deliver the decision the British people had just voted for?\nThe first point to make is that the process cannot easily be separated from the political mayhem that would then unfold.\nAt the very least, David Cameron and his top lieutenants, Chancellor George Osborne and Foreign Secretary Phillip Hammond, would be fighting for their political lives - with every action and statement viewed through that prism.\nRecently I put the prime minister's comment that he would not resign, in the event of a leave vote, to a pro-Brexit Tory backbencher. \"He's right,\" came the response, \"of course he won't resign; we'll sack him.\"\nThere's already speculation that, in the event of a leave vote, the PM would, John Major-like, seek an immediate vote of confidence from his troops and dare a rival to break cover.\nHis pitch would be the need for continuity to get the UK through a difficult patch, a message which would be much more powerful if there was some external crisis under way, at the time.\nOn the other side of the Commons chamber, the interval between referendum day and the Commons summer break represents a window of opportunity for a coup attempt against Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, before the rules on leadership challenges might be changed at the party conference, so it is possible both the main parties would embark on the withdrawal process in headless chicken mode.\nEven so, events might well move very fast. Parliament, due to be in recess until the following Monday, might be recalled for its first Saturday sitting since the Falklands War - that would be at the prime minister's discretion.\nThe key questions MPs will pose, whenever they get to debate the result, would mostly, but not exclusively, revolve around the timetable and mechanism for withdrawal.\nThe question of whether emergency measures will be needed to restrict access at the UK's borders, to stop a wave of migrants trying to get in before withdrawal, might also be raised.\nThen the process questions would start: when would the government trigger the process by invoking Article 50 of the Treaty of the European Union, which starts a two-year process for leaving?\nThe argument for doing so immediately is that it dispels any hint of prevarication; the argument against is that two years is quite a short time for a long and complex negotiation, so it might be better to open discussion, while the government's finger hovers over the start button, and eke out a year or more before formally starting the process.\n\"There's everything to be said for delaying triggering Article 50, until preliminary talks have made some progress,\" says Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative chairman of the Commons Treasury Select Committee.\n\"It is absurd to suggest there would be any breach of trust, when everyone knows we would be committed to leaving.\n\"The overwhelming majority of the electorate will accept that, by negotiating for a while before the two-year period, we increase the scope for securing a smooth transition, and minimising the short term economic shock that some commentators warn of,\" he said.\nNext comes the question of what the future relationship between the UK and the EU would look like - suddenly all that talk about Swiss, Canadian and Norwegian models would be very important.\nThe debates in Commons and Lords would see a series of speakers putting down markers for the negotiations. But how would they monitor what might be two years of withdrawal talks?\nSir Jon Cunliffe, former British permanent representative to the EU, suggested to the Treasury Committee there might be three sets of negotiations:\nEach of these could have huge implications for interests and individuals.\nThe normal procedure for trade treaties is that they would be laid before Parliament, along with a government explanatory memorandum, for 21 sitting days before being ratified.\nWere MPs to vote against ratification, the government would have 21 days to change minds and try again - but so wide-ranging are implications of an EU exit, that they would certainly want a much more exhaustive process, complete with real-time monitoring and debate, so that they could breathe down the necks of the negotiators.\nSo expect regular debates on the floor of the Commons, endless select committee inquiries, and possibly the creation of a special committee to ringmaster their efforts - not least because Brexiteers (the name given to those supporting an EU exit) would be very keen to ensure there was no backsliding.\nEqually critical, who would lead the process?\nOf course the prime minister would be in ultimate charge of the negotiations, but there would have to be a cabinet-level lead minister, in day-to-day charge of what might be two years of very detailed talks - just as Harold Macmillan dispatched Edward Heath to negotiate UK accession to the EU in the early 1960s.\nThat person (Justice Secretary Michael Gove would be a good bet) would probably have to be an ideologically-pure Brexiteer; there is simply no way the victorious leave side would tolerate a negotiator who was equivocal about UK withdrawal, and even the hard-line Eurosceptics who backed the PM's renegotiation - Business Secretary Sajid Javid, for example - would probably be ruled out.\nDuring the negotiating period the chosen person would be the second most important figure in the government, and if the pro-remain David Cameron remained in Downing Street, they might eclipse the prime minister.\nIt could easily become very destabilising for the government. The only parallel I could come up with was Lloyd George trying to take over the running of the First World War from Herbert Henry Asquith - which Asquith resisted on the grounds that the prime minister should be in charge, and he ended up being elbowed out of office.\nThe negotiator, in turn, would need a team behind them - and plenty of Brexiteers would relish the chance (energy minister Andrea Leadsom might be a good bet, having founded the Fresh Start think-tank, which has taken a close look at some of the issues involved).\nAnd there might well be a push to have parliamentary observers, as during the abortive attempt to create an EU constitution.\nWhile leadership battles and career calculations were under way, MPs and peers would embark on enormous legislative task.\nLeaving the EU is not as simple as repealing the 1972 European Communities Act.\nParliament would have to amend or repeal a series of other Acts, as well as 44 years' worth of EU-derived secondary legislation, especially statutory instruments passed under Section 2(2) of the 1972 Act, which would have no legal effect after it had been repealed.\nNow, none of this is an argument against Brexit - my point is simply that it cannot be accomplished with a snap of the fingers.\nLegislating our way out of the EU would be a prolonged task, especially since there does not appear to have been much preparatory work.\nTake this exchange at a hearing of the powerful Public Accounts Committee in February. Jonathan Black, director, Europe at the Treasury was questioned by the Conservative MP Stephen Phillips:\nQ: \"Mr Black, you can say it: there is no strategic planning going on in the event of a vote by the British people to leave the European Union. That's right, isn't it?\nA: \"The government's position is to remain a member of a reformed European Union.\nQ: \"There is no planning going on within the civil service as to what happens if Britain votes to leave the European Union, is there?\nA: \"The work that we are doing is focused on ensuring that the EU budget, which we are part of as a member of the European Union, is structured and spent as wisely as it can be.\"\nIt may well be that Parliament has to set up a special sifting mechanism to work through the layers of euro-legislation and decide what should, and should not, be kept.\nOne delicate issue would be the extent to which the consent of the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly and Northern Ireland Assembly might be needed.\nInternational relations are supposed to be a matter reserved to Westminster, but EU law does touch on the competences of devolved administrations, so, arguably, leaving the EU would affect their rights and powers.\nThis could prove important if some parts of the UK had voted to remain, even if the majority had voted to leave - and there is, at the very least a strong possibility that a vote for Brexit could trigger a second Scottish independence referendum.\nAnd as the process nears its conclusion, might the pro-EU forces strike back, and seek to hold a second referendum on the actual terms of withdrawal - if the deal didn't look too attractive?\nThat would be a bold gamble indeed - and possibly political suicide for those inside an overwhelmingly pro-Leave Conservative Party.\n*If the EU referendum follows the pattern of the Scottish referendum, the result should start to become clear by 02:00 BST on Friday 24 June, with a BBC projection probably available by 06:00 BST."

There is a joy to it as well,\" he says.\nThe complaints choir idea dates back to 2005 and two Finnish musicians. Birmingham was one of the first places to embrace the concept and it has been repeated in numerous cities around the world, such as Helsinki, St Petersburg, Chicago and Tokyo.\nPadden says there are some complaints which are universal, such as dog mess, traffic congestion and recycling arrangements.\nHe says it was difficult to \"narrow down\" the complaints but one of the songs has a section which is a long list of annoyances which did not make it in to the other pieces.\nAs well as the trams there was one other common complaint which was specific to Edinburgh - the festival itself.\nPadden appreciates the irony of complaining about a festival in which they are taking part but the choir members think it is useful to be able to speak out about their city being hijacked by thousands of tourists and performers every August.\nLorna Hoy says: \"Sometimes at festival time I want to wear a badge which says 'I'm not a visitor, I live here', because people from the festival just get in your way when you are trying to get to work.\"\nAnother choir member Heidi Docherty says the complaints choir gave her a way to take part in a festival which is normally forced upon the people of Edinburgh.\nShe says: \"It was a good way to get involved rather than just moan when it plonks itself on your doorstep.\"\n\"Singing about it is very reassuring. It gets it off your chest and it's a good laugh.\n\"It's a great way to vent your spleen and I think it will cheer the people of Edinburgh up on their way to work.\""

India made the dowry system illegal in 1961 but it is still rampant in the country.\nThe video has generated a lot of interest on social media:\nMeanwhile, some websites exist in India that actually help you calculate your dowry. One website showed the following message in response to some random details I submitted.\nMatrimonial website shaadi.com launched its dowry calculator on 29 April and since then more than 200,000 people have taken the quiz.\nMost users took the quiz expecting to find their dowry amount, but they were surprised with the result - instead of the amount, the quiz gave the number of dowry deaths in India.\n\"We wanted to get people's attention on this problem in a unique way and the calculator helped in achieving that goal,\" explains Aditya Save of shaadi.com.\n\"Dowry is an evil practice, but has unfortunately gained social legitimacy in some parts of the country. So it gets very difficult to make people pay attention to a problem they are already aware of.  But the calculator seems to have worked,\" he says.\n\"Among the people who took the quiz, more than 85% were women and that just shows how concerned they are about this problem,\" he adds.\nThe initiative has been praised on Twitter.\nMr Save denies allegations that the initiative is a \"clever marketing initiative\".\n\"We are in the business of wedding but are totally against the system of dowry. We want our subscribers to highlight cases of dowry demands, so we can take action and ban such people,\" he says.\nBBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.
