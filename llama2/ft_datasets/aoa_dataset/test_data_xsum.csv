"Patrick Joseph Connors, 59, his son Patrick Dean Connors, 39, and nephew William Connors, 36, denied requiring a person to perform forced or compulsory labour between 2010 and 2013.
They were convicted by a jury at Cardiff Crown Court on Tuesday.
Connors senior was jailed for 14 years, Patrick Dean for six-and-a-half years and William for four years.
Patrick Joseph Connors' son-in-law Lee Carbis, 34, who was cleared of forced labour, but found guilty of kidnap, was jailed for two-and-a-half years.
Catrin Evans, of the Crown Prosecution Service in Wales, said the men were guilty of ""exploiting and controlling"" their vulnerable victim in a ""callous manner over a prolonged period of time"".
'Modern slavery' victim 'emotionally broken'
The Connors kept Michael Hughes, 46, in ""appalling conditions"" in south Wales and paid him less than Â£10 a day for years.
He said: ""I am over the moon at today's verdict. Both myself and my family can now move on and I am so happy to have my life back - a life that I never knew existed.
""Those people stole my life but the outcome of today's trial means that they will now face the justice that they deserve.""
Judge Neil Bidder QC said the three Connors, who operated a tarmacking business based at a farm in Rumney, treated their victims as little more than objects.
He said: ""All the offences which you, Patrick Joseph Connors, have been convicted of are examples of conduct designed to keep two vulnerable men in what can only be described as modern-day slavery - in the case of Michael John Hughes, for 21 years.
""By the end of that time he had been completely conditioned to being used by you as a serf.""
The court heard over the course of the trial, Patrick Joseph Connors forced Mr Hughes to work for him for long hours, paying him tiny sums or just with alcohol and tobacco.
Mr Hughes was ""hunted down"" when he escaped and beaten ""all the time"", he said in evidence.
He was made to live in ""appalling conditions"", including in a 1.2m (4ft)-wide garden shed with no heating or running water for two years.
The court heard the only respite came when Mr Hughes was sent back to Scotland for unpaid fines and jailed. He said prison was ""like a holiday camp"" compared to his ordeal in Wales.
Connors senior was also convicted of eight counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm (ABH), four of kidnap and one charge of conspiracy to kidnap, while Patrick Dean Connors was also found guilty of kidnap.
The jury was told to return not guilty verdicts on a charge of conspiracy to kidnap against Patrick Dean Connors and another of assault against William Connors.
Gwent Police's Ch Supt Paul Griffiths, who led the investigation, said: ""These types of crimes have a lasting effect on the victims - it is not just the physical degradation, it's psychological too. It causes deep and long-lasting trauma.""",Three family members have been jailed for forcing a man to do heavy labour for tiny amounts in Cardiff.,36332024
"The visitors were closing in on three points thanks to Christian Nade's first-half penalty and a fine finish from Robert Thomson.
But Martin Boyle's late effort - after Daniel Harvie scored an own goal and James Keatings had a penalty saved - earned Hibs a point.
A mistake from goalkeeper Alan Martin handed Boyle the equaliser.
It meant two lost points for Dumbarton, who fall behind Raith Rovers, into eighth spot after the Kirkcaldy side's win over Dundee United.
Dumbarton looked extremely well organised at the back in the first half, with space for the Hibs strikers at a premium.
And the visitors were awarded the chance to take a shock first-half lead when Marvin Bartley needlessly bundled Andy Stirling to the ground just inside the home team's 18-yard box.
Former Hearts striker Christian Nade made no mistake in despatching the ball beyond goalkeeper Ofir Marciano.
When the home side equalised through a Harvie own goal, few inside the ground would have expected anything else other than Hibs going on to secure a victory.
However, Thomson restored the visitors' lead with a stunning shot from 22 yards out to give the travelling support hope their team could secure their first win at Easter Road in more than 30 years.
Martin, on loan from Hamilton Academical, had an afternoon he is likely to remember for a long long time.
He kept Hibs at bay with stunning saves from Keatings and Brian Graham. None better than the penalty stop from Keatings that denied Hibs an equaliser after they laid siege on the visitors' goal.
However, only he knows what he was thinking about when he dropped the ball on the edge of his box, allowing Boyle to nod the ball into the empty net to salvage a point.
If, or indeed when, Neil Lennon manages to get his Hibs side over the line and secure their place back at Scottish football's top table, he will have plenty to think about regarding who he should retain on the playing staff.
With 10 draws in the league this season, the Easter Road side are far from the finished article and the inconsistency shown at times by many of his squad could lead them towards the exit door in the summer.
With two huge games coming up in the next 10 days against their closest challengers, Falkirk and Greenock Morton, the league title could all but be in the bag.
However, any slip ups and those two, under two of the shrewdest managers around, Peter Houston and Jim Duffy, will look to pounce.
Hibernian head coach Neil Lennon: ""I'm frustrated as we deserved to win the game. Ridiculous goals we are giving away.
""Our attitude towards the game in the first half wasn't good enough.
""This team has to be more consistent. I'm not scratching my head because I see it so often now.
""We are at home, but the malaise sets in and they are not learning.
""If they think they are going to get to the Premiership playing like that, they won't - and, if they think they are going to play like that in the Premiership, they will have to think again because it's not acceptable.""
Dumbarton manager Stephen Aitken: ""I certainly enjoyed the performance of the players. We enjoyed the result.
""It could have been a bit better, but if we are assessing the game in an honest manner then Hibs bossed the game in the second half.
""The goalkeeper makes a save from the penalty, so we have to be happy. He is gutted about the equaliser, but at the same time, he kept us in the game.
""He walked in and apologised for costing his team three points, but I said to him he gained us a point.""

"Kamiyah Mobley, who was abducted in July 1998, was found after a tip.
Authorities in Walterboro, South Carolina, have charged Gloria Williams, 51, with kidnapping.
Ms Mobley was living under another name and believed Ms Williams to be her mother. The biological family have been notified of the news.
Jacksonville Sherriff's Office said DNA tests had confirmed Ms Mobley's identity.
She appeared in good health, a ""normal 18-year-old woman"", it said.
The office said it had acted on 2,500 tips since the abduction and received one last year to @MissingKids that eventually broke the case.
It showed the original composite images released at the time of the kidnapping, along with a photograph of Ms Williams, who was arrested at her home on Friday morning.
The baby was only eight hours old when she was taken by a woman posing as a health care worker at the University Medical Center, now known as UF Health Jacksonville.
The woman told Kamiyah's mother, Shanara, that her baby had a fever and needed to be checked. She took the baby out of the room and disappeared.
The case brought significant media attention as Shanara tried to locate her child.
Although the biological family had been notified of the discovery and were ""elated"", the Jacksonville Sherriff's Office said: ""It is up to the victim on how contact will be made. The victim is now an adult.""
Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said: ""She had an idea that something may have occurred but... imagine her trying to process this.

"The Global Slavery Index 2013 says India has the highest number of people living in conditions of slavery at 14 million.
But Mauritania has the highest proportional figure with about 4% of its population enslaved.
The report's authors hope it will help governments tackle what they call a ""hidden crime"".
The index was compiled by Australian-based rights organisation Walk Free Foundation using a definition of modern slavery that includes debt bondage, forced marriage and human trafficking.
""A lot of governments won't like hearing what we have to say,"" WFF chief executive Nick Grono told the French news agency Agence France-Presse.
""Those governments that want to engage with us, we will be very open to engaging and looking at ways in which we can better measure the issue of modern slavery.""
The organisation's estimate of 29.8 million slaves worldwide is higher than other attempts to quantify modern slavery. The International Labour Organisation estimates that almost 21 million people are victims of forced labour.
India, China, Pakistan and Nigeria have the highest numbers of people enslaved, the charity said.
Together with five other countries, they account for three-quarters of the total estimated number of people in modern slavery worldwide.
The report said India's ranking was mostly due to the exploitation of Indians citizens within the country itself.
While the highest proportion of slaves is in Mauritania, with many people inheriting slave status from their ancestors, Haiti is second in the index and Pakistan is third.
The new survey has the backing of world figures including former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, ex-British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
Mrs Clinton said that although the index was not perfect, it provided a starting point, according to the Associated Press.
""I urge leaders around the world to view this index as a call to action, and to stay focused on the work of responding to this crime.""","Nearly 30 million people around the world are living as slaves, according to a new index ranking 162 countries.",24560937

"Official documents obtained by Reuters news agency show government lawyers advised the US it might be considered a co-belligerent under international law.
The Obama administration has continued to authorise weapons sales to Saudi Arabia despite the warnings last year.
On Saturday, an air strike on a funeral hall in Sanaa killed some 140 people.
The coalition denied responsibility for the attack, but Washington said it would review its support to ""better align with US principles, values and interests"".
US President Barack Obama agreed to provide ""logistical and intelligence support"" to the coalition after it intervened in the conflict between forces loyal to Yemen's internationally-recognised government and those allied to the rebel Houthi movement in March 2015.
Since then, more than 4,125 civilians have been killed and 7,207 injured, the UN says, with air strikes believed to have caused about 60% of the deaths.
The documents detailing US government concerns about the civilian casualties and the potential legal implications for US military personnel were obtained by Reuters under the Freedom of Information Act and date from May 2015 to February 2016.
One document quotes a state department official as telling human rights groups in October 2015 that he believed coalition strikes were ""not intentionally indiscriminate but rather result from a lack of Saudi experience with dropping munitions and firing missiles"".
""The lack of Saudi experience is compounded by the asymmetric situation on the ground where enemy militants are not wearing uniforms and are mixed with civilian populations,"" the official said.
""Weak intelligence likely further compounds the problem,"" he added.
US officials also compiled a list of ""critical infrastructure"" that should be spared to enable Yemenis to restart commercial access and deliver humanitarian aid.
An email shows state department officials organised a meeting in January to discuss ""options to limit US exposure to LOAC [Law of Armed Conflict] concerns.""
The Law of Armed Conflict prohibits attacks on civilians and says civilians and civilian objects must be spared from incidental or collateral damage to the maximum extent possible when military objectives are attacked.
Reuters reported that another email made specific reference to a 2013 ruling from the war crimes trial of former Liberian leader Charles Taylor, who was found guilty of aiding rebels who committed atrocities in Sierra Leone during its civil war.
The ruling found that ""practical assistance, encouragement or moral support"" is sufficient to determine liability for war crimes.
In August, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International said they had documented more than 70 unlawful coalition air strikes, some of which they believed might amount to war crimes, and 19 attacks using internationally-banned cluster munitions.
The coalition has said its forces have clear instructions not to target populated areas and to avoid civilians, and has dismissed previous allegations of civilian deaths as fabricated or exaggerated.",The US government is concerned it could be implicated in potential war crimes in Yemen because of its support for a Saudi-led coalition air campaign.,37607248

"These aren't real products, of course, but an art project poking fun at Asia's obsession with beauty and its propensity for conspicuous consumption.
The display was created by the inaugural cohort of Singapore-based graduates of the Glasgow School of Art, which set up its first overseas campus here in 2011.
The Scottish arts institution is looking to expand its course offerings over the next few years and aims to help develop the city-state's creative scene.
""We hope that we can use this platform and build relationships with other parts of the region using it as a hub,"" said its director, Tom Inns.
""To be an international art schools you've got to understand how the world works in terms of regions and different thinking and different cultures.
""It is only by being there that you can only really begin to understand that. You can't understand that from a distance.""
But if the experience of the last foreign creative arts school to open up in Singapore is anything to go by, there may be some challenges ahead.
This summer, the editing labs and sound engineering stations at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts in Asia will fall silent for good.
The campus, set upon three-acres of prime property in central Singapore, is closing less than 10 years after opening due to millions of dollars of debts.
NYU still operates two degree-granting, liberal arts research university campuses in Abu Dhabi and Shanghai.
""Despite its significant creative success, the Tisch Asia campus failed to become financially sustainable,"" says a university statement.
John Beckman, vice president for public affairs at New York University said that reflecting back, they had ""learned a number of lessons"" from their experience.
""Academically and artistically, the Tisch Asia campus was a tremendous success,"" he said. ""But academic excellence is also expensive"".
""We were too optimistic about prospective enrolments both internationally and locally, the latter of which has been pivotal to many global academic initiatives.
""We operate on the principle that we will not direct money from the campus in New York to sustain global operations, we should have factored in a greater degree of support needed beyond tuition, especially in the critical start-up years.""
Mr Beckman added that Tisch Asia ""as a relatively small, independent graduate arts conservatory, was an ambitious enterprise"".
""The general lesson we learned was that it would have been better to have developed such a significant project as part of - and not separate from - our university-wide global efforts.""
The closure was not just a high-profile and expensive failure for the school, but for the Singapore government, which had invited them to set up here in 2007.
However, Tisch Asia is not alone.
In recent years, Australia's University of New South Wales, the University of Las Vegas Nevada and Warwick University have all exited, mostly due to financial reasons.
Singapore used to publicise its aim of becoming a global education hub, saying it hoped the sector would ultimately contribute up to 5% of its gross domestic product (GDP).
More stories from the BBC's Knowledge economy series looking at education from a global perspective and how to get in touch
The Economic Development Board (EDB), which seeks to bring investments to Singapore, launched the ""Global Schoolhouse"" project in 2002.
The scheme saw it offer millions of dollars in grants and subsidies to attract top names here. In many ways, it has been quite a success.
French business school INSEAD has been operating its satellite campus. American Ivy League university Yale also launched here, despite some controversy.
But following the high-profile failure of Tisch Asia and other foreign universities, it seems the government has changed its tune about attracting more entrants.
Alvin Tan, the EDB's assistant managing director of corporate development, says that in recent years the local higher education provision has increased in ""diversity and quality"" and he talks of any future incoming institutions as being a ""complement"" to strong local options.
A university's future in Singapore doesn't only come down to financial considerations, however.
The University of Chicago's Booth School of Business decided to relocate its campus from Singapore to Hong Kong in order to be situated closer to the China market.
William Kooser, the associate dean of global outreach at the University of Chicago said their lease in Singapore was expiring this year and that their strategy came up for review.
""There are a couple of things that schools need to understand before they decide to go overseas,"" said Mr Kooser.
""One is that it's not easy. It is not simply a matter of duplicating what you do in the United States and plopping it into another city.
""Two, you need to understand what it is you are trying to get out of the programme. Is it simply trying to create revenue? Or is it something beyond that?
""If it is simply to create revenue, if you don't to meet your revenue targets, it's easy to pull out. If you are trying to achieve something else you are typically in it for the longer haul.""
Singapore is regularly cited for its high quality of life, political stability, low-tax environment and ease of doing business.
However, the city-state's rising cost of living has led to major issues for both foreign universities and students.
It is the most expensive country in the world, according to an annual survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit.
Singapore's booming property prices and strong currency has also translated into high rent and tuition fees.
Then there is the question of getting a job after graduation.
Singapore's labour market has tightened over the last few years, making it harder for foreigners to get job here.
One year after the Glasgow School of Art's first graduation ceremony, another group of students are preparing their final year projects.
It is a sweltering hot day and they are on campus despite it being a school holiday, listening to pop music while painting large wooden panels. Their enthusiasm is clear.

It does not, or course, stand a prayer of becoming law, both because 10-minute rule bills hardly ever do, and because there is virtually no support in the Commons for the idea, and even those who do want a second referendum may balk at backing a bill from the Lib Dems.
But beyond that, just imagine the scene, with the staunchly pro-Leave DUP behind him, and Labour MPs, increasingly infuriated by the way the Libs are seeking to outflank them as the party of Remain, to his right, this could very quickly turn into something resembling parliamentary bear-baiting, even before the Conservatives get involved.

Elsewhere there's a lot of finishing-off on not very controversial bills - with the biggest contested legislation probably the Digital Economy Bill, where there are a number of major issues in play - including new ""fit and proper person"" tests for the individuals running companies involved in media mergers and acquisitions, and the creation of new offences around online ticket-touting.
Here's my rundown of the coming week:
The Commons opens (2.30pm) with Education questions - and any post-weekend urgent questions or ministerial statements will normally follow at 3.30pm.
The main debate is on the second reading of the Prisons and Courts Bill - which aims to reform the prison system, strengthening safety and security, improving efficiency and services for users in courts and tribunals, and reforming the claims process for minor whiplash injuries resulting from road traffic accidents. It also provides for greater use of mobile phone blocking technology in prisons.
In Westminster Hall (4.30pm) MPs debate e-petition 166847,  which complains that insurance companies are making it harder and harder for people aged 18 to 25 years of age to start driving. Premiums for first year drivers can be ÃÂ£2,500 or more - completely unaffordable for many. The petition has attracted 185,175 signatures.
On the committee corridor, Public Accounts has a headline grabbing session (3.30pm) on ambulance services - they will quiz Department of Health Permanent Secretary Chris Wormald about evidence that half a million hours of ambulance time are wasted every year, as ambulances queue outside Accident and Emergency departments.
There's also a ground-breaking meeting of the Scottish Affairs Committee (1.15pm) in what is effectively a joint session with the Scottish Parliament's Social Security Committee, to look at the impact of devolving control of disability benefits to Holyrood.
In theory the MSPs will be witnesses, but they will be sitting around the same table as MPs and quizzing witnesses. This could become the template for more joint working between parliaments.
In the Lords (2.30pm), peers will be have their second day of report stage debate on the detail of the Digital Economy Bill, where peers will consider clauses dealing with online pornography and age verification (including calls to ensure that data used for age verification to be kept confidential), social media abuse, Ofcom, the BBC licence fee (new clause from Lib Dem super-lawyer Lord Lester would require the PM, and all ministers and agencies to protect the independence of the BBC and reserve the licence fee exclusively for the BBC).
Another new clause (32A) calls for the creation of an independent BBC Licence Fee Commission to recommend what the charge should be.
Watch out for New Clause 33ZG which aims to ensure the main public service broadcasters -  BBC1, BBC2, ITV1, Channel 4 and Five - are at the top of channel listings or Electronic Programme Guides on all TV platforms. On the new Sky box (Sky Q) the default when you turn your TV on is not live TV but the 'Top Picks' of recent programmes chosen by Sky.
The Commons day begins (11.30am) with Health questions.
The day's Ten Minute Rule Bill is from Labour's Karen Buck - who wants to require householders to notify local authorities of an intention to register accommodation for short or holiday lets. She's concerned about the impact of letting through sites like Airbnb - you can let for 90 days, but many people are doing far more than that, and such letting a can breach mortgage agreements and insurance terms - and there's a huge emerging problem about it invalidating the insurance for commonhold properties.
Other issues include controlling anti-social behaviour and tax evasion. Councils are having to monitor websites to keep track of letting levels on their patch and enforce the law...
MPs then dispatch the report and third reading of the Intellectual Property (Unjustified Threats) Bill  which deals with the problems of threats to sue for infringement being abused, to stifle new ideas and competition. This is an uncontroversial technical measure - and should be waved through with minimal debate. After that MPs will have a general debate on fuel poverty.
The adjournment debate, led by the Conservative Will Quince, is on public health guidance and baby loss - he has spoken in the Commons about his experience of having his son stillborn.
In Westminster Hall, debates include the relationship between the DVLA and private car parking companies - Kevin Foster (9.30am-11am);  the 60th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome - Stephen Gethins (11am-11.30am); the UN international day for the elimination of racial discrimination - Dawn Butler (2.30pm-4pm);  pensions in the nuclear decommissioning industry - Patricia Gibson (4pm-4.30pm) and Stoke on Trent, City of Culture 2021 - Ruth Smeeth (4.30pm-5.30pm).
My committee pick is the Home Affairs hearing (2.15pm) on hate crime and its violent consequences, where the witnesses are all MPs: Lindsay Hoyle, the Deputy Speaker in charge of MP security, Home Office Minister Sarah Newton and the Solicitor-General Robert Buckland.
In the Lords (2.30pm) the main event is a government debate on the current challenges to the international rules-based order; the preparedness of the UK's armed forces and that of Nato; and the levers available to HMG to promote the country's defence and security interests.
This debate and a Statutory Instrument approval motion on the Armed Forces Act 2017, to maintain parliamentary approval for the armed forces, will be taken together. These are followed by a short debate on the EU Committee's report on Brexit - Gibraltar.
The Commons meets at 11.30am for Cabinet Office and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Questions, followed, at noon by Prime Minister's Questions.
There will then be some brief formalities as the Labour MP and former Chair of the Home Affairs Committee, Keith Vaz, presents a bill to increase the minimum custodial sentence on conviction for possession of a knife or other offensive weapon for an offender aged 18 years or over and to increase the minimum period of a detention and training order for a person aged 16 or 17; to set a minimum custodial sentence on conviction for an offender in possession of a knife or other weapon and intending to commit any offence or having such a weapon available to use in committing murder. He won't make a speech - but the title of the bill will be read out....
Then comes what could turn out to be a very lively event indeed; Tim Farron will present a Ten Minute Rule Bill for a second EU referendum ""on the proposed terms for the United Kingdom to leave the European Union"" (see above).
The day's main legislating is on the Pension Schemes Bill, which deals with the regulation of master trust pension schemes - a popular option under the new auto-enrolment system.  MPs are expected to polish off the report and third reading stages of debate fairly rapidly.... and they will then move on to a general debate on exiting the European Union and global trade.
In Westminster Hall, the subjects for debate include Iran's influence in the Middle East (9.30am -11am) and the roll-out of universal credit (2.30pm-4pm) - Newcastle MP Catherine McKinnell says her constituency office has been ""overwhelmed"" with casework relating to the problems around the 'Full Service' Universal Credit
My committee pick is the Work and Pensions hearing (9.30am) on self-employment and the gig economy, with evidence from experts and think-tanks. This picks up on the Budget controversy around National Insurance for the self-employed.
In the Lords (3pm) there are some amendments down for the third reading debate on the Higher Education and Research Bill , where the government has suffered a series of defeats at report stage, but they all come from the government spokesman, Lord Younger of Leckie, so they will be technical tidying-up or to meet assurances given during earlier stages of debate.
Then comes the final half-day of report stage consideration on the Digital Economy Bill, where more significant issues will be up for debate, including the rules on the ""Crown Jewels"" listed sports events, the suddenly topical subject of media mergers - watch out for a new clause proposed by Labour's Lord Puttnam and the Conservative former cabinet minister Lord Lansley, which would require Ofcom to impose a ""fit and proper persons"" test for individuals involved in mergers of broadcasting and media enterprises.
This would include looking at the ""extent of any criminal wrongdoing that has taken place by companies and other organisations under their control; and the extent of any failures of corporate governance and management in such companies and organisations"".
Peers will also look at new laws on ticket touting, including outlawing ""bots"" which buy up tickets online before fans can buy them - a practice which makes it difficult for ordinary folk to buy tickets without paying a considerable mark-up to online ticket touts.
The Commons opens (9.30am) with International Trade questions followed by Women and Equalities questions, and the weekly Business Statement setting out the future agenda for the Commons. It's also the last chance for the Leader of the House, David Lidington, to keep his promise to hold a debate on moving parliament out of its Victorian home before Easter.
Then the Conservative Bob Blackman leads a debate on the compensation due to Equitable Life policy holders in the light of the Parliamentary Ombudsman's ruling that the collapsed company had not been properly regulated. The motion calls on the government to make a commitment to provide ""full compensation to victims of the scandal as the economy continues to recover"".
The day's second backbench debate, led by an interesting alliance of the former deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg; the former education secretary Nicky Morgan, and Labour's Lucy Powell, a former shadow education secretary, on the annual State of the Nation report from the Social Mobility Commission. The motion highlights the Commission's warning that social mobility is getting worse, and calls on the government to lead a renewed approach in the early years, in education, skills and housing, to improve social mobility.
In Westminster Hall (1.30pm) there are debates on two select committee reports - on the Syrian refugee crisis, from the International Development Committee, and on DfID's programme in Nigeria, from the International Development Committee.
In the Lords (11am) peers debate the report from the Science and Technology Committee,  A time for boldness: EU membership and UK science after the referendum.  And then the report from the EU Committee: Brexit: environment and climate change.
The Commons sits (9.30am) for its final day on the current crop of private members' bills.
And while the agenda lists an impressive number of bills for debate, in practice only the first few will be considered.
The ones with top priority are the bills which have cleared their committee stage consideration, starting with the Conservative Wendy Morton's pretty uncontroversial Local Audit (Public Access to Documents) Bill, which extends public access to certain local council audit documents.
""I am ever the optimist for PMBs on sitting Fridays,"" she told me. If her bill is rubber stamped through its report stage and third reading, fairly rapidly, MPs will move on to the Merchant Shipping (Homosexual Conduct) Bill, a tidying-up measure to remove obsolete offences from the statute book, proposed by the Conservative John Glen.
On its last appearance, it was denied formal approval without debate, after a Conservative colleague, Chris Chope, objected to it because MPs had not discussed the amendment which would make the bill retrospective. Mr Glen hopes to get the bill through, unamended, with the backing of the government and Labour, and if he does, another Conservative, Kevin Hollinrake, might have time to get his Guardianship (Missing Persons) Bill through third reading, too.
A long list of bills lurks further down the agenda - but they have no chance of being debated, and will be ritually pole-axed at the end of the day's proceedings.
Although some may well be re-incarnated in the next parliamentary year's private members' bill process, which will get underway when the lucky winners of a bloc of debating time are announced, at some point in June.","After the sound and fury of the Brexit Bill, the Westminster agenda seems rather more quiet in the coming week, with much of the most significant action taking place on the committee corridor.",39305412
"""After eight wonderful years on The X Factor it's time for me to move on,"" he said in a statement.
""I'd like to thank ITV, Simon [Cowell], The X Factor family and particularly the viewers, all of whom have been a big part of my life for so long.""
The 41-year-old took over from Kate Thornton in 2007 as host of the popular talent show.
The presenter and broadcaster currently presents a show on Radio 2 and recently completed a 24-hour dance challenge for Comic Relief.
""I'd like to wish the team all the best for the future, especially whoever takes over from me,"" O'Leary continued.
""You're about to be the conductor on the most brilliant, runaway train in showbiz. Good luck you'll love it!""
The news of his departure may fuel speculation that O'Leary is a contender to replace Jeremy Clarkson on the BBC's Top Gear.
Before Friday's announcement, William Hill had O'Leary as 6-1 to take over following the BBC's decision not to renew Clarkson's contract earlier this week.
Before The X Factor, O'Leary hosted Big Brother's Little Brother, Channel 4's companion show to its long-running reality show.
He has presented on BBC Radio 2 since 2004 and has hosted the National Television Awards since 2010.
Bookmakers Ladbrokes have made singer Olly Murs, a former X Factor runner-up, favourite to take over the vacant presenting role.
A spokesman for ITV said O'Leary had been ""a fantastic host of The X Factor"" and that the channel was ""sorry to see him go"".

"Lawyers for the 15-year-old have also begun proceedings against Google and Twitter.
The lawsuit centres on publicity surrounding his arrest last month by police probing a major hack into the phone and broadband provider's website.
Details of the case emerged after some reporting restrictions were lifted.
The three newspapers defending the action - The Daily Telegraph, The Daily Mail and The Sun - all gave undertakings to protect the boy's identity pending the outcome of the case.
The judge at the High Court in Belfast also granted injunctions against Google and Twitter in a bid to remove any online references to the teenager's name and address, and images or information about his physical appearance.
The boy was among four people to be detained in connection with the TalkTalk hacking probe.
He was interviewed on suspicion of offences under the Computer Misuse Act before being released on bail.
Since then, his lawyers have issued writs claiming negligence, misuse of private information, defamation, breach of confidence and data protection.
As part of their action, they took legal steps to secure the removal of material published about the boy and where he lived.
The court heard that his family has had to move home after the publicity around his arrest.
It was claimed that he could be identified from newspaper articles and photographs that appeared at the time.
A barrister for the boy said the content contributed to his client being ""stigmatised"" within his community.
He said the teenager's name also featured in tweets and online searches.
During one of a number of hearings in the case, a lawyer for the Daily Mail rejected claims that it had revealed his identity.
She said the newspaper altered the boy's appearance and changed his hair colour in the photo it used.
She said his name and address had not been published, and added: ""It's our client's view that they did not identify the plaintiff.""
A temporary ban on reporting on the application for an injunction was imposed over fears that it could trigger further internet searches.
But after steps by Google and Twitter to remove the information, reporting restrictions were relaxed.
An order prohibiting the publication of any material that could lead to the boy being identified remains in place.
The case is due to be heard again next month.",A boy arrested in Northern Ireland over a cyber-attack on TalkTalk is suing three national newspapers for an alleged breach of privacy.,34744153
"Rachel Booth was at the rally on 11 June in Manchester, which organisers said was ""against Islamic hate"".
She said she attended in sympathy for the victims of the Manchester attack that killed 22 people on 22 May.
Moor Nook Primary School, in Preston, confirmed a member of staff has been suspended ""pending further inquiries"".
Thousands of people attended the march by a coalition that calls itself UK Against Hate, held three weeks after a suicide bombing at an Ariana Grande concert.
The rally also drew hundreds of people in a counter-demonstration against the march.
Mrs Booth, who has worked at the school for four years, said the suspension was ""a big shock"".
""I have never been in any kind of trouble with police.
""The grounds for suspending me are it was an EDL march, which is a load of rubbish. Even if I was part of the EDL, which I'm certainly not, it should not have affected my job.""
She said she attended with her mixed race husband, who is a former serviceman, to show solidarity with the bombing victims, not to support far-right extremism.
""I thought it was for the children and so I went,"" she added.
The march was criticised at the time by Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham who tweeted: ""These EDL-types who came today need to have a look at themselves.""
In a letter to the school, Mohammed Fyaz, one of the march's organisers, wrote ""the event in question was not organised by or linked to the EDL in any way"".
He added: ""In the democracy in which we live political, religious and moral issues should be allowed to be discussed, questioned and at times challenged freely, without fear of persecution or discrimination.""

"Workshops are being held at the the city's Royal Cornhill Hospital using specially modified goggles, gloves and other equipment to simulate symptoms.

"He was making a rare public speech as part of mass celebrations involving troops, and military vehicles in Pyongyang to mark the 70th anniversary of the ruling Workers' Party.
Thousands of soldiers - many with red banners - marched past him through the city's main square in tight formation.
An aircraft flypast forming the number 70 flew over the square.
Tanks and missile carriers rolled past the podium where Mr Kim spoke.
Parade in pictures
At the scene: Steve Evans, BBC News, Pyongyang
The parade was truly amazing in its immensity and organisation. It lasted for two hours with countless rows of soldiers and then civilians marching past without break.
It felt at times like a meeting of a cult with citizens of North Korea jumping up and down and waving ecstatically at Kim Jong-un.
The message was clear from the podium:  China stands by North Korea - signalled by Kim Jong-un clutching the hand of a senior Chinese leader - and, secondly, that Mr Kim shows no sign of a softer stance towards the United States. As he put it:  ""The party's revolutionary armament means we are ready to fight any kind of war waged by the US imperialists"".
If his words were not clear enough, the hardware on parade underlined them - line upon line of trucks with missiles following line upon line of heavy artillery.
The changing face of North Korea
Strange history of North Korea's Communist Party
State television carried the events live, adding an emotional commentary.
""Iron spirit and the united forces of our army and people have enabled us to break through the imperialists' sanctions and isolation, are forcing the enemies to extreme anxiety and fear,"" Mr Kim said.
Later, as the parade continued, tens of thousands of civilians, including school-children, danced and waved coloured pom-poms.
When it announced plans for the anniversary earlier this year, the government spoke of ""cutting-edge"" weaponry suitable for modern warfare, and the day's event will have been closely watched for any new military hardware indicating the North's military development.
No world leaders attended but China, North Korea's closest ally, sent a senior Communist Party official to the anniversary.
The North Korean leader began the day by paying respects to his late father and grandfather at the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun in Pyongyang, official media reported.
The celebrations continued, after a downpour of rain, with an evening torchlight parade which thousands of Pyongyang citizens have been seen practising for in public squares across the city.
A late-night concert featuring the all-female Moranbong Band - North Korea's most popular musical group - was also held, which cost foreigners wanting to attend about $115 (ÃÂ£75), the Associated Press news agency reports.
North Korea's nuclear programme has long been a cause for alarm in the region.
Pyongyang is believed to have conducted three underground nuclear tests and is threatening a fourth, despite international condemnation and sanctions.
Last month, it announced it was restarting its main nuclear facility Yongbyon and that it was improving its nuclear weapons ""in quality and quantity"".
The North claims it has made a nuclear device small enough to fit into the warhead of a missile.
US officials, however, have cast doubt on this claim and experts say it is difficult to assess the progress North Korea has made on miniaturisation.

Ms Abbott was criticised for her performance during the election campaign, in which she stumbled several times during interviews and appeared unable to give detailed answers to questions.
In one interview with LBC Radio, she mistakenly said plans to boost police numbers by 10,000 would cost ÃÂ£300,000. It led to a barrage of criticism from the Conservatives who said she could not ""add up"".
She pulled out of an interview on BBC's Woman's Hour with just a few minutes' notice amid unconfirmed reports that some within the party leadership had lost confidence in her.
Just 48 hours before polling day, Labour said Ms Abbott was taking a period of sick leave and would be replaced ""indefinitely"" by Lyn Brown.
Ms Abbott, a key ally and friend of Jeremy Corbyn, said she was badly affected after facing six or seven interviews in a row without eating enough food - vital to managing blood sugar levels.
""During the election campaign, everything went crazy - and the diabetes was out of control, the blood sugar was out of control,"" she said.
Ms Abbott, who was re-elected as MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington with a majority of more than 30,000, accused her political opponents of mounting a ""vicious"" campaign against her.
She told the newspaper she was disappointed a female prime minister had singled her out as a national target.
The Guardian says a Conservative source ""angrily rejected"" Ms Abbott's accusations and said it was ""legitimate in a campaign to point out weaknesses in the opposition's front bench""
The source wished Ms Abbott well with her health, adding: ""No-one knows more about the difficulties of diabetes than the prime minister.""

The transfer includes the Royal Photographic Society (RPS) archive, which features key historical objects from the medium's development.
Fewer than 10 items from the RPS collection are currently on permanent display in Bradford but the majority can be viewed by appointment.
The archive will join the V&A's existing collection of 500,000 photographs to create an International Photography Resource Centre.

"Seagulls defender Shane Duffy headed in Oliver Norwood's corner against his former side to put the visitors ahead.
Dale Stephens' volley after the break doubled the lead before Rovers' Sam Gallagher fired in from close range.
Brighton substitute Glenn Murray chipped in to seal the win after Blackburn's Gordon Greer was sent off, before Gallagher grabbed a consolation.
Murray's 13th league goal of the season and first away from home this campaign, came after Rovers goalkeeper Jason Steele dropped Lewis Dunk's shot at the striker's feet.
Any chance of a comeback by the hosts had already been made more difficult at 2-1, when ex-Brighton captain Greer was shown a second yellow for a foul on Bournemouth loanee Murray 16 minutes from full-time.
Gallagher smashed in his ninth Championship goal this season and second of the evening after racing clear in stoppage time, but it was too late for Owen Coyle's struggling side in front of a season-low crowd of 9,976 at Ewood Park.
Rovers have now lost 11 of their 21 Championship fixtures and Cardiff's win over Wolves ensured they slipped into the relegation zone.
In contrast, Brighton have been defeated in just seven of their past 68 league games in a run stretching back to May 2015, but will be replaced by Newcastle at the summit if the Magpies win at Wigan on Wednesday.
Duffy, who arrived on the south coast in August, has now scored four times against Rovers this season - three of them own goals.
The 24-year-old turned into his own net in a 3-0 defeat at Wigan on 13 August.
Four days later Duffy scored two first-half own goals and was then sent off in stoppage time in a 2-1 loss at Cardiff - his final league match for the Lancashire club.
Blackburn manager Owen Coyle told BBC Radio Lancashire:
""I thought we started the game really well on the front foot against a team I would say along with Newcastle look very, very big favourites certainly for automatic promotion.
""We certainly made one or two chances, but we accepted they were very dangerous on the counter-attack. At 2-1. We felt we were right back in it with a chance to turn the game on its head.
""But, it's a huge turning point when Gordon picks up the second yellow card. There was certainly contact and it leaves us with 10 men against one of the most difficult sides to face.
""They battled away and kept going, giving everything they could. There's plenty of heart and plenty of spirit, but we're conceding far too many goals.
Brighton manager Chris Hughton told BBC Sussex:
""That was closer than what we deserved and what it should have been. That's my only disappointment of the night.
""But, I thought we broke really well at times and at certain stages of the game, we could have been really out of sight.
""Ultimately, it's about three points and every away victory is a valued victory. No games are easy on the road so I'm delighted with the three points.""

Many travel great distances in search of a better life in Europe and some end up living in a makeshift camp in Calais in France hoping to make their way to the UK.
Now the French government have asked them to leave parts of the camp that are close to a motorway.

"Government figures show 375 doses, sent to addresses in England, Wales, and Scotland, were seized in 2016, compared with just five in 2013.
Taking the pills while pregnant without medical approval is illegal in the UK.
The British Pregnancy Advisory Service said as awareness of the online pills increased, more women were using them.
The figures, from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) - which regulates medicines in the UK - show there were 375 pills seized last year, up from 270 in 2015 and 180 in 2014.
The seizures were made during the MHRA's annual week-long raids, known as Operation Pangea, at places like postal hubs where foreign post is kept before being distributed to local post offices.
NHS abortion treatment is free and widely available in Britain, but remains mostly illegal in Northern Ireland.
However, the UK currently has the harshest punishment for self-induced abortion of any country in Europe, bar the Republic of Ireland.
Under the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, anyone taking the pills could, in theory, be punished with a life sentence - no matter what the gestational period.
Two women have been jailed for using the abortion pill bought online in the UK.
In 2012, 40-year-old Sarah Catt was jailed for eight years for terminating her pregnancy with pills she had bought online when she was 39 weeks pregnant.
Natalie Towers, 26, was sentenced to two-and-a half-years in 2015 after using the pill to terminate her pregnancy while she was between 32 and 34 weeks pregnant.
Bpas and other women's groups are supporting a bill, proposed by Labour MP Diana Johnson, to be debated in the House of Commons next month, which seeks to decriminalise abortion.
Some women have revealed why they were driven to using abortion pills purchased online.
""I was hoping to have a termination in the comfort of my own home without judgmental eyes and without worrying about my husband knowing. I fear what would happen if he did,"" one woman said.
""I have three children and my third is 11 months old. I considered an abortion when he was conceived and had a terrible pregnancy and [I am] still suffering from post natal depression.""
Another, a foreign student living in the UK, said she felt ""desperate"".
""I cannot afford this country's prices of procedure, and the place in line for supported abortions is just too long and not guaranteed.
""I feel absolutely horrible and desperate.""
Clara Watson, education officer for the charity Life, said the promotion of buying abortion pills online was dangerous.
""Some women aren't suitable for the abortion pill and may suffer from blood clots, there may be other underlying health issues, they may not know how far along they are. It's too risky,"" she said.
Ann Furedi, Bpas chief executive, said women who bought the pills were often ""desperate"" and in ""difficult circumstances"".
""At Bpas, we do all that we can to make abortion services as accessible as possible. However, it is clear that for some women the barriers to clinic-based treatment feel insurmountable,"" she said.
""They are not criminals deserving of life imprisonment. Evidence suggests that as awareness of online abortion pills is increasing, so too are the numbers of women using these methods.""
She said women should not face criminal punishment.
""Fifty years after the 1967 Act was passed, it is time to bring women's reproductive healthcare into the 21st Century and remove abortion from the criminal law,"" she added.
""By doing so we would remove the clinically unnecessary legal barriers to treatment.""
She also urged women in need of advice or help to contact Bpas.

On 13 March, Labour MP Ms Johnson is proposing a Ten Minute Rule Bill that would repeal the relevant sections of the Offences Against the Person Act and decriminalise abortion.
This is the first piece of pro-choice legislation to be debated in the House of Commons since the 1967 Abortion Act and if it became law, it would protect women who use online abortion pills from criminal sanction.

"It follows reports in a German paper of repeated clashes between Theresa May and Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker at a Downing Street dinner.
EU sources claimed UK misunderstanding of the talks process, and ignorance about how Brussels works, could lead to no deal being agreed on the UK's exit.
Home Secretary Amber Rudd said the reports were ""tittle-tattle"".
She said the emergence of the reports was ""not the right way"" of negotiating, but the UK was committed to negotiating in ""good faith"".
According to the Frankfurter Allgemeine, the prime minister and Mr Juncker reportedly clashed over Mrs May's desire to make Brexit ""a success"" and whether the issue of protecting the rights of expat UK and EU nationals could be agreed as early as June.
The newspaper claimed Mr Juncker said: ""I leave... 10 times more sceptical than I was before.""
In a speech later on Tuesday, Mrs May - who has dismissed the account as ""Brussels gossip"" - will cite the need to stand up to the other 27 EU countries
""We have seen in recent days, it will not be easy,"" she will say. ""The negotiations ahead will be tough. Across the table from us sit 27 European member states who are united in their determination to do a deal that works for them.""
The German newspaper's report of the dinner last Wednesday, which looks to have come via European Commission sources, said that after the PM said she wanted to ""make Brexit a success"", Mr Juncker's response was: ""Brexit cannot be a success. The more I hear, the more sceptical I become.""
And when she said the UK owes no money to the EU, the president informed her that she was not leaving a ""golf club"".
The article said that, after last week's dinner, Mr Juncker was shocked at Mrs May's suggestion that a deal on citizens' rights could be achieved so quickly.
The German newspaper report also suggested Mr Juncker said there would be no trade deal between the UK and the rest of the EU if the UK failed to pay the ""divorce"" bill which it is expected to be asked for.
Reports also claim that the morning after the dinner last Wednesday Mr Juncker told German chancellor Angela Merkel that Mrs May was ""on a different galaxy"".
A senior Conservative source told the BBC that the party would ""rise above"" all the media coverage but rejected accounts of the dinner, saying: ""We really, really do not recognise those reports.""
Ms Rudd said the UK would not be responding to the claims but the government had set out a clear plan and priorities for the talks and Mrs May was the best person to negotiate a Brexit deal that was in the UK's ""national interest"".
""Once you start engaging in gossip, in tittle-tattle in this way, it (will) carry on and who knows where it will lead?"" she told BBC Breakfast.
""Nobody knows how much truth there is in gossip. But there are ways of conveying what is going on and this is not the right way.
""I do not recognise the tone in which this has been reported but I come back to the fact that it does make it clear that it is going to be a complex, potentially difficult negotiation at times and who do we want leading those - we want Theresa May leading them, not Jeremy Corbyn.""
Welcome to the EU/UK dominated Brexit Galaxy of Spin and Counter-Spin. A crazy old place. The galactic atmosphere is such these days that the dimensions of truth are elastic; at times, distorted.
Take the arguments this weekend over whether the Downing Street dinner last Wednesday at which Theresa May hosted European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker was a complete disaster or not.
Not at all, insists Downing Street.
But according to an EU diplomat, speaking to Germany's Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung and thereafter hitting Twitter and headlines across the UK, they went ""badly, really badly"".
He reportedly went as far as to say the British government was now ""living in a different galaxy"" to the EU when it came to Brexit expectations. This all seems rather inflammatory, so who's right and who's stretching the truth?
The accounts of the dinner were seized upon by European politicians and opposition parties in the UK.
Guy Verhofstadt, the former Belgian prime minister who leads the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, said it was time to ""get real"". He tweeted: ""Any Brexit deal requires a strong and stable understanding of the complex issues involved.""
Former Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said Theresa May's desire to pull the UK out of the single market and other EU institutions was leading to an ""increasingly belligerent"" atmosphere with the EU.
""No 10 appears to be treating the rest of the EU as if they are running the Home Office, just barking instructions and expecting them to fall into line,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today
""This is a complex, Rubik's Cube negotiation which requires agility and charm to be successful. None of that appears to have been in evidence at that dinner last week.""
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mrs May was sending out ""rather mixed messages"".
""To start negotiations by threatening to walk away with no deal and set up a low tax economy on the shores of Europe is not a very sensible way of approaching people with whom half of our trade is done at the present time.""
However, UKIP leader Paul Nuttall urged Mrs May not to give any ground, tweeting: ""We don't owe the EU a penny and in fact there is a pretty good case that they owe us.""

"His comments were captured in a recording of a closed-door meeting, the Daily Beast reported.
The current round of direct peace talks between the Israelis and Palestinians appear to be at an impasse.
But President Barack Obama has said the US will not abandon its peace efforts.
By Paul DanaharBBC Washington bureau chief
The US state department is telling everyone that it's no big deal that John Kerry used the 'A' word to describe the impact on Israel if the two-state solution for the Israel-Palestinian conflict collapses.
A spokeswoman has pointed out that senior Israeli politicians have also referenced apartheid before when talking about the risks to Israel's reputation. This point though is frankly spin. It is one thing for Israeli politicians to use provocative language in their own political arena. When used by the US secretary of state it adds legitimacy to the debate about whether there is an equivalence between the old South African regime and the situation on the West Bank.
Whether the ""apartheid"" reference was a gaffe or deliberate there is no doubt that Secretary Kerry believes Israel's government is stubbornly ignoring his warnings that a failure to agree a peace deal will feed a campaign trying to delegitimise their state.
Mr Obama has previously rejected the use of the term ""apartheid"" in discussion of the Middle East peace process, calling it unhelpful and inaccurate.
But in remarks before a group of high-ranking officials from the US, Europe and Japan known as the Trilateral Commission, Mr Kerry used the word.
""A two-state solution will be clearly underscored as the only real alternative,"" Mr Kerry said, according to the Daily Beast.
""Because a unitary state winds up either being an apartheid state with second-class citizens - or it ends up being a state that destroys the capacity of Israel to be a Jewish state.""
Mr Kerry also reportedly suggested a peace deal was more likely to come with a change in Israeli and Palestinian leadership, and strongly criticised Jewish settlement construction on occupied territory.
The American-Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac) condemned his comments as ""deeply troubling"".
""Any suggestion that Israel is, or is at risk of becoming, an apartheid state is offensive and inappropriate,"" it said in a statement.
In a statement to the BBC, the US state department noted that Israeli leaders had used the term ""apartheid state"" before, to warn of the consequences of the failure of the peace process.
""Secretary Kerry, like Justice Minister [Tzipi] Livni, and previous Israeli Prime Ministers [Ehud] Olmert and [Ehud] Barak, was reiterating why there's no such thing as a one-state solution if you believe, as he does, in the principle of a Jewish state,"" spokeswoman Jen Psaki said.
""He was talking about the kind of future Israel wants and the kind of future both Israelis and Palestinians would want to envision. The only way to have two nations and two peoples living side by side in peace and security is through a two-state solution. And without a two-state solution, the level of prosperity and security the Israeli and Palestinian people deserve isn't possible.""
Last week, Israel suspended the current round of US-brokered peace talks, which resumed last July after a three-year hiatus, demanding the annulment of a reconciliation agreement between two main Palestinian factions.
Fatah, which is led by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, and Hamas, which governs Gaza, said they planned to form a unity government in the coming weeks.
Hamas rejects Israel's right to exist and is designated a terrorist group by the US, EU, Israel and other countries.
Mr Netanyahu told the BBC that Mr Abbas could ""have peace with Israel or a pact with Hamas - he can't have both"".
The US expressed ""disappointment"" over the unity deal, but pushed for the talks to continue.
Last week, Mr Obama said his administration would continue to offer ""constructive approaches"". But he added that ""neither side had political will to make tough decisions"" and that there might need to be a pause in the process.","The US Secretary of State, John Kerry, has warned that Israel risks becoming ""an apartheid state"" if a two-state solution to the conflict with the Palestinians does not emerge soon.",27195254
"The fifth biggest firm in South Korea gets an estimated 30% of its sales from China, and employs about 20,000 people there.
But in the past week, several of its businesses have faced a backlash from hackers, customers and Chinese partners.
On Monday, Lotte said that more than 10 of its department stores across the country had been closed down suddenly. So what's going on?
At the end of February, Lotte finally agreed to provide land it owned in South Korea - which includes part of a golf course - so the US could build its controversial Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defence system.
With the ability to shoot down ballistic missiles, the US says it is an important line of defence against North Korea's missile development programme.
But over the past few months, Beijing has been lobbying heavily against it - saying the system's powerful radars are capable of monitoring Chinese territory.
It disputes the argument that it will bring more stability to the region, saying it should not be allowed to go ahead.
As well as its shops and food businesses, Lotte also has hotels and cinemas in China. But since signing the deal last week Lotte, has reported various operations in China have been disrupted.
On Monday, photos and videos were circulating of protests outside Lotte stores. ""South Korea's Lotte has declared war on China. Lotte supports THAAD. Get the hell out of China"" said one banner.
While confirming the department store closures, Lotte has given no explanation. Other incidents include:
Prior to the missile deal being signed, Lotte had reported its businesses being put under extra scrutiny from tax authorities. And in February, a multi-billion dollar property project in China's north-east was halted after a fire inspection.
Beijing certainly has not admitted any economic retaliation and Lotte has been restructuring loss-making China businesses.
But China's state-run news agency Xinhua has described Lotte's decision to provide the land as ""opening a Pandora's box in North East Asia.""
Separately, it has written that ""the decision could turn into a nightmare for Lotte, which depends heavily on Chinese tourists to South Korea for revenue from duty free stores"".
Meanwhile Lotte itself has not said directly that any of the incidents were linked to the missile project controversy.
But South Korea's trade minister Joo Hyung-hwan, who has recently had an invitation to an annual forum withdrawn, has expressed ""deep concerns over a series of actions in China"".
""We will act accordingly to international law against any actions that violate policies of the World Trade Organization or the free trade agreement between South Korea and China,"" he said.
There are reports of a broader backlash against South Korean products and industries from China.
China's national tourism administration has told travel agencies to stop selling group packages in South Korea, according to South Korean news agency Yonhap.
And Yonhap also reports that some Chinese streaming platforms have removed Korean material from their sites - a blow to viewers of the dramas which are increasingly popular.","China is a crucial market for many South Korean companies, and the food and retail giant Lotte is no exception.",39176388

"But Leicester's squad of freebies and unknown imports have shocked the football world with their Premier League triumph, becoming household names and fully fledged international stars along the way. These are the stories of the 14 key players from a team that cost less than Â£30m.
Schmeichel started his career as a Manchester City trainee. He made his senior debut on loan at Darlington in 2006 and was also loaned to Bury and Falkirk before making his debut for the Blues.
He played just three games for City in the whole of 2008 and was so far down the pecking order in January 2009 his agent enlisted the help of BBC Sport's Chris Bevan to get him a move, via our BBC transfer deadline day live text commentary.
Schmeichel issued a statement expressing his ""great disappointment"" when Leeds accepted Leicester's offer for him in June 2011.
We don't think he regrets that now...
Manchester United academy product Simpson was sent out on loan to Belgian side Royal Antwerp and Sunderland, where he won the Championship title in 2007, plus he had spells at Ipswich Town and Blackburn Rovers.
He eventually made his Premier League and European debut at Old Trafford before he joined Newcastle United in 2010. He helped the Magpies win promotion back to the Premier League and also won promotion via the play-offs after his move to QPR.
In 2014 he signed for Leicester and is now a Premier League champion. He was convicted of assaulting his girlfriend last May - a conviction he is appealing against.
The 30-year-old had been persuaded to join the Foxes by then manager Nigel Pearson, who was sacked in June. Fuchs said he was lying on a beach in Antigua when he was told Pearson had been sacked. ""I'd spoken to a coach, he'd convinced me to go there, and I will never have one training session with him. It was very weird.""
Fuchs has 46,000 followers on Twitter, whom he entertains with his dressing room insights and games such as Russian egg roulette with team-mate Jamie Vardy.
The Jamaica international was released by Notts County in 2000 and signed for Dunkirk FC in the Midland Football Alliance, while enrolling on a course to become an accountant, before Nottingham Forest spotted him.
Leicester signed Morgan for about Â£1m in January 2012. He had already made 379 appearances for Forest, including 123 in League One.

Morgan owns a chain of tattoo parlours in Leicester, with former youth team-mate Scott Tynan. Their regular clients include team-mates Jeffrey Schlupp and Fuchs.
But Morgan's talents do not extend to the actual tattooing. He said: ""I tried it once on pigskin. It was a terrible effort. I was just trying to draw a smiley face but it looked more like a letter C.""
Claudio Ranieri first brought Huth to England from Germany in 2001, signing him for Chelsea where he won two Premier League titles.
He moved to Middlesbrough for Â£6m in 2006 but was relegated to the Championship two years later, before joining Stoke where he was voted player of the year.
After a loan spell with Leicester, the defender - capped 19 times by Germany - signed permanently in June 2015 and tweeted: ""Now the sexy football show rolls into Leicester!!""
Some of the players who have also won three Premier League titles include Dennis Bergkamp, Cristiano Ronaldo, Patrick Vieira, Ashley Cole, Carlos Tevez and Jonny Evans.
Kante made his professional debut in the second tier of French football with Boulogne in 2011. Following relegation he impressed in the third tier the following year and was picked up by Caen in 2013. With them he played all 38 games of the season and missed just one match in the following campaign.
Kante was much smaller than the players around him at youth level and struggled to find a team to take him on, arriving at Boulogne thanks to a connection with the president of Suresnes, the amateur club he played for growing up.
He has been praised for his work-rate in midfield, interceptions and tackling - and has been given the nickname 'The Rash' by team-mate Danny Drinkwater for his aggressive persistence.
Drinkwater was another player who started his career at Manchester United, joining the academy as a nine-year-old. He was part of the United Under-18 side that reached the FA Youth Cup final in 2007, but lost to Liverpool on penalties.
Drinkwater left the Altrincham College of Arts in Cheshire with nine GCSEs.
The 26-year-old was loaned out to Huddersfield, Cardiff, Watford, Barnsley, but never made his senior debut for United.
He joined Leicester in 2012, helping them win promotion to the Premier League in 2014 and was named in the PFA Championship Team of the Year that season.
Albrighton had been with Villa since the age of eight, making his competitive debut in the Uefa Cup game at CSKA Moscow on 26 February 2009.
The winger made his first Premier League appearance on 15 August 2009 against Wigan Athletic, a club he would later be loaned out to in 2013.
Albrighton, who joined Leicester in May 2014 after being released by Villa, has represented England at under-20 and under-21 level.
The slight but talented forward was born in the tough Parisian suburb of Sarcelles and lost his father, Ahmed, to a heart attack at the age of 15.
He first club was AAS Sarcelles before he moved Quimper in 2009, just over 350 miles from Paris.
Mahrez spent his first six months in their second team before gradually making his way through the ranks. He lived with Mathias Pogba, brother of Juventus star Paul Pogba, who described him as too skinny, messy and said he enjoyed a diet of steak and French fries.
Apparently, as recently as 2010, Mahrez did not know how to take a throw-in properly. And, like his Leicester team-mate Jamie Vardy, the winger had to overcome concerns about his size.
But he has gone on to become the first African to be named PFA Player of the Year, with 17 goals and 11 assists.

During a four-year spell in Germany he became the leading Japanese goalscorer in the league's history, adding 27 with Mainz to 10 for Stuttgart.
He puts his goalscoring form down to discovering fish and chips while at Leicester.
""I like fish and chips!"" Okazaki said. ""I have them sometimes, maybe once every two weeks, then I am happy. Now when I have scored I want some fish and chips. It is better than pizza.""
After being arrested for assault, Vardy had to wear an ankle tag when he was with Stocksbridge Park Steels. He was not allowed to be out outdoors after 6pm, and at away matches could only play one hour to get back in time. He was 20 and earning Â£30 a week at the time.
At Fleetwood he scored 31 goals as the team were promoted to the Football League for the first time.
He joined Leicester in 2012 for a record fee for a non-league player of Â£1m (rising to Â£1.5m) after impressing Pearson and also former West Brom and current England manager Roy Hodgson.

The 2015-16 season started on a low point for Vardy as he was fined by the club after claims he made a racial slur in a casino.
In November became the first player to score in 11 consecutive Premier League matches and signed a new three-year deal in February.
When he was in Year 10 at Oakgrove School, his designs for a new garden on the grounds were made into reality. It wasn't all his own work though - Max Crowcombe, the Oxford United goalkeeper, also contributed.
Schlupp spent three weeks on trial at Manchester United in 2013.
The 29-year-old earned a then club-record Â£8m move to Leicester in 2014 after scoring 26 goals in 58 appearances for Brighton in the Championship.
He has never played international football and turned down the chance to represent Chile, for whom he is eligible through his grandparents.
He is the all-time highest-scoring midfielder in the club's 132-year history.
When the Foxes won the Championship in 2014, he tweeted: ""So the best weekend of my life comes to a close... what a few days... we finally did it!!""
How is he feeling now?
The 64-year-old took over at Chelsea in 2000, bringing in players such as club legend Frank Lampard.
He was manager when Chelsea were taken over by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich in 2003, and spent Â£120m on players. He was nicknamed 'The Tinkerman' for over-rotating his squad.
Ranieri was sacked in 2004 and replaced by Jose Mourinho.
Ranieri has become a cult hero at Leicester with his man-management, giving players pizza and his unique take on things, as he led the team to the most unexpected league title in history.

"The so-called Valley fire is thought to be one of the worst in the state's history, and is still only 30% contained, spanning three counties.
One disabled woman has died and four firefighters have been injured, while 23,000 people have been forced to flee their homes.
Two dozen fires are raging in Oregon, California and Washington state.
But the most destruction is in California, where mandatory evacuation orders have been lifted in some areas so residents can return to survey the devastation.
Firefighters are scrambling to protect not only homes but the state's famed giant Sequoia trees, as the largest of a dozen fires edges ever closer to one of the national parks in which they grow.
While the Valley fire has been the most destructive, covering an area twice the size of San Francisco, a second known as the Butte fire, outside Sacramento, has claimed 166 homes.
Firefighters say it is covering 71,780 acres (29,048 hectares) and is now 40% contained.
Officials say fire teams have been helped by cooler weather and higher humidity, although the forecast is for higher temperatures to return at the weekend
In California, the sound of summer is the crackle of flames. No one here in Lake County can remember anything like the Valley Fire.
Firefighters say it has already consumed an area twice the size of San Francisco. And still it burns, leaving behind a landscape drained of colour, silent and lifeless.
Ranches which stood here for more than a century were wiped out in seconds. And in the little communities of Cobb, Middletown and Hidden Valley, entire streets have been destroyed.
For mile after mile the ashes are still smouldering. Most people have not yet been allowed to return to inspect the damage but when they do many will find that there is nothing to salvage.
Cooler weather with some moisture in the air is helping but it will take more than that to stop the blaze. The fires burns and burns and California is counting the cost.
In northern California, people who have been evacuated from their homes or lost their homes completely are gathered at emergency centres and high schools.
Andy Elliott, a British firefighter working to battle the Valley fire, said it is one of the most extreme in California for a long time.
Firefighters are calling it a ""career fire"", such is its speed and force, he said. ""The fire behaviour is unprecedented.""
Mr Elliot said he knew the four injured firefighters and had breakfast with them just before they were hurt.
""It's a very extreme incident... very sad.""
California is used to battling raging wildfires. But after a four-year drought, the state is suffering more than usual - 5,255 fires have scorched 217,827 acres of land so far this year, compared with 3,638 fires burning 90,894 acres during the same period last year.
Northern California is currently bearing the brunt of the blazes, with 13,000 firefighters working 24-hour shifts to try to contain more than a dozen fires sweeping across parched hillsides in Butte, Lake, Napa and Sonoma counties.
But Calfire's Lynnette Round says more wildfires could start anywhere in the state at any given moment. ""The terrain is so dried up that even if it rains a little, trees and brush are so dry, they could ignite at any time,"" she says.
Southern California typically experiences its worst wildfires in October and November, when ferocious Santa Ana winds - which blow from the desert to the coast - can reach up to 80mph and whip blazes across swathes of arid land.
The state's largest wildfire in recent years was in San Diego county in 2003. That burned 273,246 acres, 2,820 buildings and led to 15 deaths.
California's deadliest wildfire on record was also in southern California, according to Calfire. Twenty-nine people died in Los Angeles county in 1933.

"Meeting in Berlin, they also criticised Russia's air strikes in Syria.
It was their first summit since Donald Trump won the US presidential election. Mr Trump has criticised Nato and said he hoped for warmer ties with Russia.

In a statement, it said Nato General Secretary Jens Stoltenberg had spoken by phone to Mr Trump, congratulating him on his election victory.
In the German capital, President Obama - who has been on a farewell trip to Europe at the end of his two terms - met German Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Theresa May, French President Francois Hollande, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi and Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy.
A White House statement later said the leaders had ""affirmed the importance of continued co-operation through multilateral institutions, including Nato"".
It said they had ""agreed on the necessity of working collectively to move the transatlantic agenda forward, particularly on bringing stabilisation to the Middle East and North Africa"".
On Ukraine, the leaders said the sanctions imposed against Russia must remain in place until Moscow fully met its commitments to resolve the conflict.
Western nations accuse Russia of sending its troops and weapons into eastern Ukraine to support separatist fighters - a claim Moscow denies.
On Syria, President Obama and the EU leaders said attacks on the city of Aleppo by Syrian government troops and Russia ""should be immediately halted"".
Mrs May said the leaders ""were united in our condemnation of the atrocities that are taking place there"".
""We agreed the need to keep up the pressure on Russia, including the possibility of sanctions on those who breach international humanitarian law,"" she added.
Russia launched its air strikes in Syria in September 2015, saying it was acting at the request of President Bashar al-Assad. Moscow denies targeting civilians, saying it is bombing Islamic militants.

"He worked closely with owner Randy Lerner, who put the club up for sale last May but is yet to find a buyer.
The resignation of American Fox after 18 months at the Premier League's bottom club follows the departure of sporting director Hendrik Almstadt and three new appointments to the board.
Fox said ""it makes sense for me to seek another challenge"" following the changes in the Villa boardroom.
Villa are nine points from safety at the foot of the league and Fox and Lerner have been the target of fans' anger over their struggles.
Steven Hollis became the club's new chairman in January while former Governor of the Bank of England Lord King and ex-Football Association chairman David Bernstein have become directors at Villa Park.

"Mr Humphrey and his wife, Yu Yingzeng, were sentenced in August last year for illegally obtaining private information on Chinese nationals.
He received a two-and-a-half year sentence, while Ms Yu was sentenced to two years in prison.
GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) China, which was fined $490m in China for bribery, hired Mr Humphrey in 2013.
The pair were hired by GSK to investigate the source of a sex tape of the company's China boss, shortly before the firm became the subject of the bribery allegations.
They admitted buying information, but said they did not realise it was illegal to do so.
Release in the coming days will reduce his sentence by seven months. Time spent in custody before his trial was taken off his sentence.
Once released, he is likely to be deported, as the court originally stipulated.
Ms Yu will be released in the coming weeks, according to the Reuters news agency.
The original verdict did not make a link between Mr Humphrey's investigations and the allegations against the pharmaceutical giant GSK.
Those allegations first emerged in an email in January 2013 from an anonymous and self-styled whistleblower to the company.
The email alleged that GSK's sales teams targeted influential doctors with expensive gifts and cash to win business.
It was sent to GSK's London-based chief executive, Andrew Witty, and made accusations against GSK China's general manager Mark Reilly.
Later, a sex tape featuring Mr Reilly and his girlfriend was also sent.

"The excerpts, released on Monday, excluded the names of gunman Omar Mateen as well as Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the so-called Islamic State (IS).
Mateen, who killed 49 people at a gay Orlando nightclub, described himself as an ""Islamic soldier"" and pledged allegiance to al-Baghdadi during his phone calls to authorities.
But in the first version of the transcript, any reference to IS or their leader was removed.
For example:
Police: What's your name?
Mateen: My name is I pledge allegiance to [omitted].
The decision to omit the names sparked outrage among Twitter users including US House Speaker Paul Ryan.
The Wisconsin Republican denounced the decision to redact as ""preposterous"" and called on the Obama administration to release the full transcript ""so the public is clear-eyed about who did this, and why"".
""We know the shooter was a radical Islamist extremist inspired by Isis. We also know he intentionally targeted the LGBT community,"" Mr Ryan said in a statement, referring to IS.
Other users expressed outrage over the decision to remove IS from the text.
The Department of Justice released a statement later on Monday defending the redaction.
Officials said they wanted to remain sensitive to the victims, their families and the ongoing investigation, while also not providing ""the killer or terrorist organisations with a publicity platform for hateful propaganda"".
""Unfortunately, the unreleased portions of the transcript that named the terrorist organisations and leaders have caused an unnecessary distraction from the hard work that the FBI and our law enforcement partners have been doing to investigate this heinous crime,"" the statement said, before releasing the full transcript of Mateen's first 50-second phone call.
The other calls he made were not released.
Mateen first called a 911 dispatcher about 30 minutes after he began shooting. During the call, Mateen spoke Arabic and praised ""God the Merciful"".
In a later phone call, he told a negotiator to tell America to stop bombing Syria and Iraq and that was why he was ""out here right now"", according to the FBI transcript.
Mateen also told negotiators he had an explosive vest similar to the kind used by terrorists ""in France,"" making a reference to the November terror attack in Paris. But no vests were found.
""[Mateen] does not represent the religion of Islam, but a perverted view,"" said Ron Hopper, the FBI assistant special agent in charge.
""Part of the redacting is meant to not give credence to individuals who have done terrorist attacks in the past,"" he said.

Two former interior ministry officials, several serving and former mayors, and a number of executives in state-owned firms were also detained.
The move comes after Serbia opened talks to join the EU, which has long pressed Belgrade to tackle corruption.
Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic said the charges for those arrested included abuse of office, money laundering and other financial crimes.

The world number two expects to be back on court as early as January 2018.
Tennis matches between men and women have occurred before, mostly notably back in 1973 when Billie Jean King took on fellow American Bobby Riggs.
Riggs, the world number one in the 1940s, retired in 1951 and at the age of 55 believed he could beat any of the top female players.
King originally declined to play Riggs and Australian Margaret Court - at the time the top female player in the world - stepped in. Riggs won 6-2 6-1.
But later that year, the top-ranked women's player King - 26 years younger than Riggs at 29 - took him on in an exhibition match at the Houston Astrodome and won 6-4 6-3 6-3.
A third 'battle of the sexes' match took place in 1992 between American former world number one Jimmy Connors, aged 40 at the time, and Czech/American Martina Navratilova, who was 35.
The match took place under special rules to make it more competitive - Connors was allowed only one serve per point, and Navratilova was allowed to hit into half the doubles court.

"Daniel Young, 30, was attacked in Kendor Gardens near Morden Underground station shortly after 08:00 GMT on Tuesday.
A post-mortem examination found he died from a stab wound.
A 35-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and is currently in custody.
On the day of the attack a 26-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder and wasting police time. He has been bailed.
Mr Young, originally from Paignton in Devon, was attacked as he made his way to the London Campus of Coventry University for the second day of a new job.
He was attacked in a park used by commuters as a short cut to Morden Tube station and Morden Road tram stop.
It happened less than 40 minutes after a 23-year-old man was stabbed in the buttocks in nearby Lewis Road.
Scotland Yard said it was investigating whether the two attacks were linked and trying to establish the motive and whether the attacker was known to Mr Young.
Meanwhile, an online fundraising page apparently set up in memory of Mr Young has been removed after his family reportedly said they had no knowledge of it.
Police said they understood that the donations made through the Gofundme page would be refunded. The Met's Cyber Crime Unit is investigating.
On Facebook, Mr Young's brother Simon wrote: ""My Brother. My friend. I'm still wrapping my head round this, still hoping/wishing it's a sick joke.

""Teams don't have to sell like they used to,"" said Wales' Taylor.
""I think what you're going to find is that with the money coming to the Premier League teams don't have to sell. That might mean a few more clubs hanging on to their best players.""
Swansea head coach Francesco Guidolin has said he expects interest in midfielder Sigurdsson this summer.
The 26-year-old Iceland international won Swansea City's supporters' and players' player of the year awards after scoring 11 goals in the club's successful fight against relegation.
He is under contract at Swansea until 2018, but has been linked with a number of big clubs, while Ayew has said his future depends on a summer discussion with chairman Huw Jenkins.
""It's the same every year for our club, we have players that come through, they do well,"" said Taylor, who was visiting his old school Ysgol Brynhyfryd in Ruthin before joining up with the Wales squad for their training camp in Portugal.
""Gylfi is someone that has come now in two spells and done well for us. We want to keep hold of them obviously, Andre has scored goals.
""But just like when we lost Wilfried Bony and people down the years and we lost Sigurdsson the last time, we do lose important players because they get poached by bigger teams.
""It's important that we try and keep them and add to that this season because we've realised how hard it is.""
Swansea have been linked with summer moves for two of their former players - Manchester City striker Wilfried Bony and Liverpool midfielder Joe Allen.
Ivory Coast international Bony joined City from Swansea for Â£25m in 2015, while Allen left for Liverpool for Â£15m in 2012.
Both have struggled to nail down starting places at the north-west clubs and Taylor admits he would be delighted to see them return to west Wales.
""There is a lot more work to be done than just somebody to say that we want them back. You have to talk about money, you have to talk about whether the players want to come back here,"" Taylor said.

"The 1912 painting was purchased by the London gallery in early February.
The museum paid ÃÂ£15.6m ($25.5m) for the artwork. The money will go towards operating costs at Randolph College in Virginia, which owns the Maier Museum.
AAMD, which represents 236 directors of leading US art museums, called upon the college ""to stop this practice"".
The Association was it was ""deeply disturbed to learn of Randolph College's continuing sale of works of art from the collection of its Maier Museum of Art to provide general operating funds for the College"".
""The prohibition against the sale of works of art from museum collections for such purposes is a violation of one of the most fundamental professional principles of the art museum field,"" a statement said.
'Other solutions'
The AAMD said it initially contacted Randolph College in 2007 when its intention to sell off works from the college-owned Maier Museum was first made public.
The Association said it offered help by investigating other means by which the college could tackle its financial shortfall.
But in 2008 the college sold a Rufino Tamayo painting, Trovador, prompting the AAMD to censure the Maier Museum ""to signal its objection to this action"" and ""discourage"" further sales from the collection.
Following last month's Bellows sale, it once again sought ""to encourage the College to find other solutions"" to support their operating costs.
The college's unwillingness to alter their course led to the announcement of sanctions, which calls on all AAMD member museums to suspend loans to the Maier Museum and refuse collaboration on joint exhibitions.
""We appreciate both the College's decision to sell Men of the Docks to a public institution, thus ensuring that this work will remain in the public domain, and the educational exchange that the College and the purchaser of the painting, the National Gallery of Art in London, are launching,"" the statement continued.
""Nevertheless, these steps - however laudable they may be - do not mitigate the fact that the funds realised from this sale will be utilised for a purpose that we believe will, ultimately, be damaging to our field,"" it added.
The Bellows purchase marked the National Gallery's first major acquisition of a painting by an American artist.
""We feel proud that an international audience will now become more aware of Randolph and our long stewardship of Men of the Docks,"" college president Bradley W Bateman said at the time of the sale.

Captain Thiago Silva set Luiz Felipe Scolari's side on the way with an early goal, and Brazil looked to be set for a comfortable passage into the last four after David Luiz's brilliant second-half free-kick.
In a magnificent atmosphere built on a cascade of colour and a wall of sound, new World Cup star James Rodriguez set up a thrilling finale when he pulled a goal back from the penalty spot with 10 minutes left.
In a frantic closing phase, Colombia were unable to force the chance that could have brought extra time, and it is the hosts who will meet Germany in Belo Horizonte on Tuesday, a game which will be live on BBC One.
""It was a fantastic occasion and a great game. Not in terms of quality but in terms of endeavour and passion.
""The game was scrappy and bitty but Brazil wanted it that little bit more. Colombia were overawed from the beginning and lost the game after conceding the first goal.
""The South American way is win at all costs and you saw that today. Yes, they gave away fouls, yes David Luiz was trying to put James Rodriguez off for the penalty, but if Brazil win this World Cup playing like that nobody will be bothered.
""If they lose, different story.""
But Brazil will be without superstar and main striking hope Neymar, who has been ruled out of the World Cup with a fractured vertebra after being kneed in the back by Juan Zuniga.
They will also be missing captain Thiago Silva, who is suspended after being booked.
Colombia had complaints of their own, chiefly the lack of protection offered to Rodriguez, who was on the receiving end of some fierce challenges as Brazil sought to nullify his influence.
He broke down in tears at the final whistle as he was consoled by the Brazil players who had offered him none of that commodity during a harrowing physical ordeal which proved he has the courage to go with his natural ability.
Brazil and their supporters, in contrast, went wild with elation at the final whistle. The goal of reaching the final - and making up for the 1950 World Cup loss to Uruguay in Rio that is still one of this nation's darkest sporting days - lives on.
Germany, who beat France 1-0 in their quarter-final, will need to show mental strength to cope with the tidal wave of emotion and support that Scolari hopes will carry Brazil to the Maracana a week on Sunday.
Fortaleza offered up a cauldron of noise and a sea of yellow shirts in an atmosphere that ensured Brazil would launch into a series of adrenalin-fuelled attacks.
Scolari's hope was to push Colombia into unknown territory and the strategy was helped by a goal built largely on defensive carelessness after seven minutes.
Neymar's corner was a routine affair with little serious menace but it was allowed to drift to the far post, where Carlos Sanchez switched off to allow Silva to bundle home.
Scolari and his players were just as aware of the threat posed by Juan Cuadrado as the celebrated Rodriguez, and he illustrated exactly why with a shot that was inches away from 20 yards.
This was much more like it from Brazil, though, and it would have been no surprise had they extended their advantage by the interval as they showed genuine threat against a somewhat timid Colombian side.
It was down to keeper David Ospina that they did not as he twice saved well from the excellent Hulk, on the second occasion recovering well to then clutch Oscar's long-range effort.
Scolari insisted Brazil had formulated no special plans to deal with Rodriguez, but it was clear they were determined to test the 22-year-old in a succession of reckless physical challenges.

It was after Rodriguez was shown a yellow card for a foul on Hulk by the extraordinarily lenient referee Carlos Velasco Carballo that Brazil scored the goal that effectively sent them into the last four.
Luiz came in off his long run to strike a 25-yard free-kick that left the stretching Ospina clutching at thin air as it flew high to his left.
The vast bowl of a stadium reverberated to an expression of relief as well as celebration.
It came just after Colombia thought they were back in the game, only to see Mario Yepes's goal ruled out for an earlier offside.
To his credit, Rodriguez was undeterred by Brazil's close attentions and it was his astute pass that led to substitute Carlos Bacca being upended by Julio Cesar. After a short delay, and some well-chosen words from Luiz, Rodriguez was calmness personified to send the keeper the wrong way.
Colombia threw everything forward in the last moments, but once again Brazil held on to seal the victory.

"The EU's new Sentinel-2a satellite has the capability to look into the water column, to see whether reefs are undergoing change.
Current, anomalously high temperatures are driving a huge coral bleaching event across the globe.
Early work suggests the Sentinel can detect the effects from 780km up.
The satellite's two images on this page show Fatu Huku Island in French Polynesia.
The one below is a full colour view of the 1.5km-long rocky outcrop.
At the top of the page, however, is a picture that displays only the ""blue band"" from the satellite's camera.
Selecting this 490-nanometre wavelength makes the submerged reef around Fatu Huku jump out.
""The blue band really goes into the water. The shorter the wavelength, the better the penetration you have,"" explained Dr Benjamin Koetz from the European Space Agency (Esa).
""With Sentinel-2a, we can see 10-15m into the water, which you just couldn't see if you were using the green band, for example,"" he told BBC News.
Esa is sponsoring a project called Sen2Coral, which had Sentinel-2a make repeat observations of the volcanic island from February to April this year.
In that time, it detected a change in sea-bottom radiance - a brightening - that is very likely related to bleaching.
A dedicated field team sent to the island at the end of February confirmed that sea-water temperatures were consistently above 30C and that parts of the reef were stressed. More work is needed though to confirm the associations.
Excessively warm water will cause coral polyps to expel their symbiotic algae. This drains a reef of its colour. It is not necessarily fatal but it can weaken the ecosystem, making it vulnerable in the face of other threats such as disease.
Bleaching has been occurring globally on a large scale of late because of the El Nino phenomenon, which sees surface temperatures spike in many ocean regions but particularly in the central and eastern Pacific.
Scientists had previously tried to observe corals in the same way as at Fatu Huku using the American Landsat spacecraft and the French Spot platform. The former does not have quite the resolution needed (just 30m versus S2a's 10m), and the latter's camera does not have the optimal band to penetrate the water column.
Ultimately, if the S2a techniques can be fully validated, it should be possible to automate the detection of change at reefs.
Scientists could then use the Sentinel to alert them, not just to possible bleaching but to other deleterious impacts such as pollution incidents and nutrient run-off from land.
The EU satellite is ideally suited to this kind of application. It is designed to map all land surfaces (and the coastal regions where corals tend to live) every 10 days. When its sister satellite (Sentinel-2b) is launched next year, this repeat time will fall to five days. All the data is free and open.
""Sentinel coverage is systematic in the sense that it covers within 20km of the coast. But this doesn't, of course, include all the corals in the world, and one of the objectives of this project is to try to understand what exactly is needed,"" said Dr Koetz.
""If we wanted to have a systematic coral reef observatory, we would have to increase the image acquisition plan, to take in all of the Great Barrier Reef, for example.""
The coral work of Sentinel-2a was highlighted at Esa's Living Planet Symposium which took place in Prague earlier this month.

Welcome to Transfer Deadline Day, which I've deliberately written in capitals because there are those who think we should make it a public holiday.
Chaotic and stressful and full of panic buying, Transfer Deadline Day and the window that precedes it make up football's equivalent of the Yuletide season, with Sky Sports' Jim White playing its equivalent of Santa. ""Sorry, no joy with Fabregas, I brought you Fellaini instead.""
A magnificent irony of transfer windows is that they were introduced in 2002-03 in part to stabilise the game.
It's about ducking and diving, maybe finding a player whose mother-in-law lives in Taunton, 10 miles down the road from Yeovil. Which isn't on most sat-navs
Transfer windows were part of a compromise deal between football authorities and the European Commission, with the sport insisting on contractual stability for players, and clubs investing in those players, in exchange for freedom of movement at prescribed times of the year.
Yet there is nothing stable about transfer windows and the media coverage that attends them. Indeed, Transfer Deadline Days in Britain, which generate mind-boggling numbers for a wide range of media outlets, have come to resemble the NFL draft in the United States.
But here is another irony. The NFL draft is by some measures the second biggest sports story in the United States in any given year because it is the principal means of player acquisition and a genuine game-changer. With the weakest team getting first pick, it democratises the league, theoretically giving every team an equal chance on any given Sunday.
In contrast, Transfer Deadline Days involve an awful lot of acquisitions across an unlevel playing field that often change nothing, but still generate enough hot air to make it seem as if they might.
""It's a period of time that is false and everything during that period of time is forced,"" says Gary Johnson, manager of Championship side Yeovil.
""Everybody has a little panic for the simple reason that the supporters demand a big name, or at least hope for one, and some of this is driven by the media. But for smaller clubs it's very difficult to get someone in that people can gasp at.""
It is difficult to find a manager who is a fan of transfer windows, whether they manage in the Premier League or the lower reaches of the Football League.
Ian Holloway, who managed Blackpool and, briefly, Crystal Palace in the Premier League, reckons transfer windows are ""utter madness"" and lead to ""the headlong hurtling into deals to rescue dreams"".
""They encourage knee-jerk reactions, inflated transfer fees and wages and minimal planning and background checks,"" adds Holloway, who parted company with Palace in October and is now at Millwall.
Johnson, whose side sit second from bottom in the Championship table, spends his Januarys being assailed by hordes of agents hawking players he had never heard of. Like a tourist in an exotic flea market, he usually ends up with something he doesn't really know what to do with.
""You don't want to miss anyone,"" said Johnson. ""So you look them up on the computer, find out what they can and can't do. But players with good character are unbelievably difficult to get.""
Other managers of smaller clubs lucky enough to have coveted players on their books see transfer windows as tantamount to restraint of trade.
The Premier League's counter argument is that either you have contractual stability for players and the squad stability that brings, or you have players being sacked at the drop of a hat or leaving at the drop of a wallet, to borrow a phrase from former Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein.
However, Holloway believes the old system, whereby clubs were allowed to buy and sell players up until and including the third week in March, was a more stable one, in that it allowed clubs to formulate long-term strategies away from the media and fan frenzy that constitutes a transfer window.
Critics of the January window point to Harry Redknapp's maniacal spending spree last year, when the then recently appointed QPR boss paid more than Â£20m for Loic Remy and Chris Samba, as evidence that long-term strategies become secondary to short-term fantasies during football's silly season. QPR were relegated a few months later.
Meanwhile, League Managers' Association chief executive Richard Bevan argues that so many managers are being sacked during the January transfer window and the weeks leading up to it because twitchy owners are unwilling to hand their money over to someone who is perceived to be failing.
In addition, Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger says the system causes unrest in the dressing room, in that an out-of-favour player might spend from November to the end of January agitating for a move, or going through the motions for fear of suffering an injury and scuppering a possible move, or worrying that they are about to be supplanted by a new signing and losing motivation as a result.
Wenger, however, has no compunction about causing unrest in rival teams' dressing rooms, having upset Newcastle boss Alan Pardew with a late bid for midfielder Yohan Cabaye last August.
The Premier League argues that a smart manager is one who is best able to deal with all these dressing room kerfuffles and play with the cards they were dealt at the start of the season.
Wenger's main complaint has always been with the January window in particular, which he believes distorts the competitive balance midway through a season. Why, asks Wenger, should a club be able to buy their way out of trouble at the expense of a poorer club which had their house in order before the season started?
Wenger's argument is moot for two reasons. First, the old system meant rich clubs were able to run riot with their cheque books for most of the season, not just in January. Second, the January window is effectively a sop to the European Commission and its directives on freedom of movement.
As it is, players' union Fifpro claims the current regulations impede players' freedom of movement and is preparing to challenge the system in the European courts.
And while some fans will be of the opinion that well-remunerated players don't deserve the same rights as the rest of us and should take their 50 grand a week and stop complaining, other fans will find it bizarre that footballers, many of them on modest salaries, have fewer rights than other workers.
Wenger does have a point in his criticism of the timing of the summer transfer window. As it stands, the window closes two weeks after the start of the season, meaning a player might play two or three games for one club before being poached by another.
""The first game of the season would be a good time to close it,"" says Redknapp. ""Then we could all concentrate on the football.""
The present system was introduced ahead of the 2002-03 season, as part of a compromise with the European Commission.
There are two transfer windows each season.
The first one for English football commences on 1 July and usually ends at 23:00 BST on 31 August.
The second transfer window begins at midnight on 31 December and ends at 23:00 GMT on 31 January, or the first working day after that date.
Before the introduction of the transfer window, players could be traded throughout the season up until 31 March.
Each national football federation has its own registration period, so international transfers can take place if the window in the country of the buying club is still open.
Free agents can be signed at any time during the season as long as they had been released by their previous club before the end of the transfer window.

The difficulty of co-ordinating the transfer window in England with other European leagues is the principal reason why the summer window has not been moved forward.
But another reason is that the media and football fans, unlike Redknapp, do not want to concentrate solely on the football. They want to concentrate on Redknapp chatting with reporters about the transfer window through the window of his Range Rover.
When transfer windows were introduced, they were seen as potentially damaging for the red tops, for which transfer tittle-tattle was a staple. But the British media have adapted, turning transfer windows into feeding frenzies for football fans of a dramatic persuasion. Which is most of them.
Last January, disaffected (you read that word a lot in the football pages in January) West Bromwich Albion striker Peter Odemwingie was spotted outside Loftus Road on Transfer Deadline Day, caught in the act of trying to force through a move to QPR off his own bat.
The Odemwingie Fiasco, as it came to be known, had some of the ingredients of a caper movie: brinksmanship, silliness, adventure and audacity, as well as the comedy of embarrassment. And the British media milked it for all it was worth.
And it is in January, when few Premier League powerhouses do big business because of players' involvement in European competition and many trades in the Football League consist of low-key loans, that the British media really excels, making fans believe there is a mega signing lurking around every corner.
""All we're trying to do is nick players here and there,"" says Gary Johnson, exposing the unglamorous truth for the majority of Football League clubs.
""It's about ducking and diving, maybe finding a player whose mother-in-law lives in Taunton, 10 miles down the road from Yeovil. Which isn't on most sat-navs.""

"There are growing divisions in the right-wing party over Mr Orban's steps to turn Hungary into an ""illiberal democracy"", despite a third election victory this year:
Even though a majority of Hungarians oppose their policies - 2.8 million against to 2.3 million in favour in April -  opposition parties are weak and divided, with the exception of the radical nationalist Jobbik movement, which has emerged as the main rival to Fidesz.
But the mood in the corridors of power is wretched. In a country where backbench rebellions are almost unknown, politicians contend themselves with hints of dissent in anti-government media, and more open attacks on Viktor Orban's policies in pro-government media.
A new, pro-Russian foreign policy sits particularly awkwardly in a party which rose to fame in 1989 as the first to demand publicly that Soviet troops leave Hungary.
It began with a photograph of Viktor Orban shaking hands with Russian President Vladimir Putin in January, after signing a highly controversial nuclear expansion deal.
When the Russians annexed Crimea in March, the Budapest government criticised the beleaguered Ukrainian government in Kiev, and stated publicly that all it cared about was the Hungarian minority in western Ukraine.
In July, Hungary's embassy in Estonia was closed down at a moment when the Baltic states - Hungary's Nato allies - felt under most pressure from Moscow.
Mr Orban has consistently opposed EU and US sanctions against Russia, on the grounds that ""we should be doves in economic policy, and hawks in defence"".
In an August speech to Hungary's ambassadors, he called openly for an unprincipled foreign policy, placing foreign investment in Hungary above any moral considerations such as a trade partner's human rights record.
And in September, within an hour of Mr Orban meeting with the chief of Russia's state-owned gas giant, Gazprom, the reverse flow of gas to Ukraine in Hungary's pipelines, which had been annoying Russia, was stopped.
Dismay is growing within Fidesz at his domestic policy too: at government corruption, the playboy lifestyle of numerous party officials, and an economic policy which consistently suppresses the value of the Hungarian currency, the forint.
There is also increasing rivalry between the oligarchs: the rich men who fund the party from behind the scenes, on a model learnt from the former communists.
""Unprincipled decisions cause harm, even if that is not visible in the short term,"" parliament speaker Laszlo Kover, a founding member of Fidesz and close friend of Mr Orban said in August in the main pro-government weekly newspaper.
This was in reply to a question on the rise of communist-era secret service loyalists and businessmen with offshore accounts in government ranks.
The editor of the same weekly, Gabor Borokai, himself a former Fidesz government spokesman, lambasted what he called a ""self-assured and arrogant social group"" of young Fidesz leaders who believed they were beyond the law. This was apparently a reference to 36-year-old Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto and his friends.
Another intra-Fidesz dispute has broken out over the extensive power of Janos Lazar, 39, the minister in charge of Mr Orban's office, who is responsible for the daily running of the government.
Other Fidesz officials, led by the head of the parliamentary group, increasingly regard Mr Lazar as a reckless and dangerous figure.
""From Hungary to Egypt, endless regulations and overt intimidation increasingly target civil society,"" US President Barack Obama said in September. This followed a government investigation into non-governmental organisations partially-funded by Norway, over alleged financial mismanagement.
The latest insult to split Fidesz came last week when the US government banned six unnamed Hungarian public officials from visiting the United States.
While the most hysterical pro-government commentators called for revenge, investigative reporters suggested that the head of the Hungarian tax authority was on the list for trying to bribe US businessmen.
That was followed this week by anger at a new government plan to tax internet use.
""Orban's illiberal democracy is the expression of a power structure where all powerÃ¢â¬Â¦ resides at the centre,"" says Peter Rona, an Oxford-based economist and former member of the supervisory board of the Hungarian National Bank.
Unlike almost all other commentators, however, he can see an end to Fidesz's rule.
Hungarian governments are traditionally brought down by the misguided policies of their central bankers.
And Mr Rona thinks Fidesz could fall too because the determination of national bank head Gyorgy Matolcsy, a former Orban minister, to keep the forint weak at all costs.",Hungarians are commemorating the anniversary of their 1956 revolution against Soviet rule but many senior figures in the ruling Fidesz party believe Prime Minister Viktor Orban is steering the country back to its authoritarian past.,29740030

"In the three months to August, output fell by 0.8%, the biggest such decline since March 2013.
Meanwhile, the UK trade deficit was Â£3.3bn in August, a narrowing of Â£1.2bn from July, it said.
But the deficit was larger than expected and is set to weigh on growth, the ONS added.
An ONS official said the weak figures for construction in August may have been linked to wet weather during the month.
Housebuilding fell by 3% from July and output in other parts of the sector also contracted for the first across-the-board decline since 2010.
The trade figures showed the UK's deficit in its trade in goods narrowed to Â£11.1bn in August compared with Â£12.2bn in July, although some analysts had expected it to shrink further.
The deficit of Â£11.1bn on goods was partly offset by a Â£7.9bn surplus on services. Exports increased by Â£0.8bn, boosted by cars.
The combined goods deficit for July and August is already twice that of the previous quarter, and is likely to have a negative effect on overall GDP growth.

"Coulson was convicted on Tuesday of conspiracy to hack phones. Goodman had already pleaded guilty in 2006.
But jurors could not decide on charges against the pair of conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office.
The judge criticised David Cameron for commenting on the case while the jury was still deliberating.
Meanwhile, the BBC has learned that one of the phone hacking victims was Carole Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge's mother.
On Tuesday the prime minister apologised for employing Coulson as his communications chief but that he had done so ""on the basis of undertakings I was given by him about phone hacking and those turned out not to be the case.""
Coulson's lawyer criticised Mr Cameron's ""ill-advised and premature intervention"" in the case - a move described as ""unwise"" by former lord chancellor Ken Clarke.
The judge commented: ""I consider that what has happened is unsatisfactory so far as justice and the rule of law are concerned.""
Discharging the jury at the Old Bailey, Mr Justice Saunders said a decision on any retrial would be made on Monday.
Five people have pleaded guilty in the case, while former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks and her husband Charlie were among the remaining defendants cleared on Tuesday.
Mr Cameron faced criticism from Labour leader Ed Miliband at Prime Minister's Questions for his decision to take Coulson with him into Downing Street.
Labour wants an investigation into why Coulson did not receive the highest level of security vetting when he joined the No. 10 operation.
But Mr Cameron insisted it had been the civil service's role to vet the appointment and that he had been exonerated by a public inquiry following the hacking scandal.
""Every single one of these issues was dealt with exhaustively by the Leveson Inquiry,"" the prime minster told MPs.
""He looked into all of these questions about the warnings I was given and the response I gave and he made no criticism of my conduct.""
The BBC's Robert Peston said that, if there was to be an investigation, it would be head of the civil service, Sir Jeremy Heywood, facing embarrassment over the failure to vet Coulson.
However, Mr Miliband listed a string of allegations about the PM's role, insisting: ""When it came to Andy Coulson, you just didn't want to know the evidence.
""This is about your character, your judgement and the warnings you ignored.""
Mr Cameron appointed Coulson as his official spokesman after becoming prime minister in 2010, only for the former News of the World editor to resign in 2011 amid growing allegations about phone hacking at the paper.
The prime minister had become ""the first ever occupant of his office who brought a criminal into the heart of Downing Street"", Mr Miliband added.
Phone-hacking verdicts in full:
Clive Goodman - the News of the World's former royal editor - and private investigator Glenn Mulcaire have already served jail terms.
In 2007 they were convicted after hacking the phones of members of the royal household.
Royals, celebrities and victims of crime had their phones hacked by the now-defunct tabloid, which closed in July 2011 after revelations about murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler's voicemails being accessed came to light.
Police say thousands of people's phones were targeted.
Other victims of hacking, who were not mentioned during the trial, included the Countess of Wessex and the Duchess of York.
In 2006, when hacking at the tabloid was first exposed, the police established that 19 members of the Royal Household or their close associates had their messages listened to illegally.
In the wake of the verdicts, Milly's sister Gemma urged the prime minister to deliver on his pledge to make ""real permanent change"" to the way the press is regulated.
Speaking after the jury was discharged, Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick said the Met had been ""conscious of the sensitivities and legal complexities of investigating a national newspaper"".
The force had been criticised for its relationship with News International and for not pursuing allegations of hacking in 2006.
But Ms Dick - who oversaw the investigation - said: ""Throughout the investigation we have done our best to follow the evidence, without fear or favour.
""This investigation has never been about an attack on press freedom but one to establish whether any criminal offences had been committed, to establish who was responsible for committing them and to bring them to justice. The victims deserved no less.""
Coulson now faces a maximum of two years in prison for hacking.
He and Mrs Brooks had an on-off affair for at least six years from the late 1990s, details of which were revealed during the trial.
Mrs Brooks was accused of retrieving boxes - with the help of her assistant Ms Carter - from the News International archive relating to her time as editor of the News of the World and the Sun.
She was also accused, along with her husband and Mr Hanna, of hiding personal computers from the police.
Five other people have already pleaded guilty to related charges of conspiracy to hack phones.
Mulcaire, a private investigator, former news editors Greg Miskiw and James Weatherup and reporters Dan Evans and Neville Thurlbeck had previously admitted their role in the plot to get stories by intercepting voicemails.

"Film studio Warner Bros is looking for a girl between the ages of eight and 12 to play the character of Modesty.
""Modesty is a haunted young girl with an inner strength and stillness,"" the studio said. ""She has an ability to see deep into people and understand them.""
The casting call will take place at the Excel Centre in London on Saturday.
The chosen youngster will star opposite Eddie Redmayne in what is bound to be one of the biggest film releases of next year.
Rowling has written the screenplay for the film, which is based on a Harry Potter spin-off book she published in 2001.
Redmayne will play ""magizoologist"" Newt Scamander, who writes a Hogwarts School textbook about the weird and wonderful fictional creatures he encounters.
Hopeful actresses have been invited to start queuing from 09:00 BST on Saturday.
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is expected to be released on 18 November 2016.
Writing on her Facebook page in 2013, JK Rowling said: ""Although it will be set in the worldwide community of witches and wizards where I was so happy for 17 years, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is neither a prequel nor a sequel to the Harry Potter series, but an extension of the wizarding world.

"The SPFL has set up a working group to examine the issue of unacceptable conduct.
And it is understood that they would seek financial assistance from the Scottish government.
The facial recognition system was mentioned at a meeting of all 42 clubs on Tuesday.
The debate over the extent to which clubs should be held accountable for the conduct of their followers has been sparked by recent incidents involving Rangers, Celtic and Dundee United supporters.
Hibernian's visit to Ibrox on 28 December was marred by sectarian chants from the home end, while there were complaints of sectarian songs during Celtic's Scottish Cup trip to Stranraer.
Celtic and Dundee United have both condemned their own fans for setting off pyrotechnics.
SPFL board member Mike Mulraney revealed there was not appetite to introduce new strict liability rules.
The Alloa chairman said there is ""no chance whatsoever"" of clubs agreeing to regulations that could see them punished for the conduct of supporters regardless of whether the club itself is to blame.
A spokesman for the league body said: ""The SPFL is working with government and other partners with the aim of establishing a workable solution to help rid our football grounds of unacceptable conduct.
""This work is at an early stage and is not being led by any one club.
""The issue of unacceptable conduct is something that the SPFL, its board and its member clubs are absolutely committed to addressing.
""Recognising that certain behaviours are for society to face and address as a whole, we believe football can take a leading role in moving this issue forward for Scottish society.""
The prospect of facial recognition technology has been met with scepticism from the Scottish Football Supporters' Association.
Chairman Simon Barrow said the fans' group is concerned by ""a rushed move towards intrusive surveillance"".
He added: ""There needs to be careful consultation with fans and clubs, alongside wider consideration of how to deal effectively and proportionately with threatening and insulting behaviour.
""The best way forward will involve working with the great majority of supporters who deplore such abuses, rather than making them feel under accusation themselves.""",The Scottish Professional Football League is considering the use of facial recognition technology at stadiums to help combat anti-social behaviour.,35356852
"Action on Junk Food Marketing analysed 750 adverts shown during the X Factor on ITV and the Simpsons and Hollyoaks on Channel 4 over 20 hours.
It found one in 10 promoted fast food restaurants, confectionery or supermarket 'junk food'.
But the government said advertising was not to blame for childhood obesity.
The analysis, which was carried out by researchers at the University of Liverpool, found that unhealthy food items accounted for 11% of all adverts and around half of all food adverts.
They said the most frequently shown adverts for unhealthy food products came from supermarkets such as Aldi and Morrisons, followed by fast food chains such as Dominos and Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC).
Chocolate manufacturers like Lindt and Cadbury and brands such as Clover and Flora Buttery were also included on the ""unhealthy"" ads list.
The researchers looked at adverts shown during 10 hours of X Factor programmes and another 10 hours of early evening Channel 4 programmes during the run-up to Christmas 2013.
The campaign group Action on Junk Food Marketing, whose members include the Children's Food Campaign and the British Heart Foundation, said children's TV viewing peaks around 20:00 but laws to protect children from targeted advertising only cover children's programmes, which tend to be broadcast earlier in the day.
Simon Gillespie, chief executive of the British Heart Foundation, said: ""Parents don't expect their children to be bombarded with ads for unhealthy food during primetime TV, but that's exactly what happens.
""Even when the show is over, junk food marketers could be reaching out to young people online. A lack of regulation means companies are free to lure kids into playing games and entering competitions - all with a view to pushing their product.""
Prof Mitch Blair, officer for health promotion at the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said advertising junk food during family-friendly programmes like the X Factor is known to work.
""Not only are children and young people easily influenced and parents worn down by pester power, but food companies wouldn't spend huge amounts of money if it wasn't effective.""
Campaigners want the ban on ""junk food"" advertising to be extended to 21:00.
""Children should not be commercially exploited and the advertising industry must take some responsibility for helping tackle the growing problem of childhood obesity,"" Prof Blair said.
The government said advertising was just one aspect in determining children's choice of food and one part of the package aimed at tackling childhood obesity and poor diet. It added that it was keeping ""this area under review"".
The Advertising Association went further saying the report was ""lobbying dressed up as science"" and the current rules on advertising were working.
Communications director Ian Barber added: ""The UK's evidenced-based approach to the advertising rules works, balancing sensible protections with the freedom to advertise, allowing companies to compete - to the benefit of us all - and providing important funding for free-to-air TV.""
But there is general agreement that with around one-third of UK children now overweight or obese, encouraging families and children to eat healthier diets is important.
Dr Alison Tedstone, director of diet and obesity at Public Health England, said they were working with the food industry to promote healthier products on TV through their Change4Life campaign.
""We recognise that we are all influenced by food adverts on TV. We are all eating too many calories and too much salt, fat and sugar which impacts on our health, causing obesity which increases our risk of cardiovascular disease, type-2 diabetes, and some cancers.""","Children are being exposed to TV adverts promoting unhealthy food which should be banned during primetime family viewing, says a campaign group.",26665952

Cilic, 28, is into his second major final after winning the 2014 US Open.
""It's unbelievable,"" said Cilic, the second Croat to reach the men's final after Goran Ivanisevic won in 2001.
""I've been playing really great tennis.""
Federer has already added to his lengthy list of achievements by reaching a record 29th Grand Slam final, becoming the second-oldest man to do so after the 39-year-old Ken Rosewall reached the 1974 Wimbledon final.
Having waited five years to win his 18th major title at this year's Australian Open, Federer could make it 19 only six months later.
""I feel very privileged to be in another final,"" he said.

Federer had won his past seven matches against Berdych, and 18 of 24 in all, but the Czech made him work for number 19.
There were just three breaks of serve over two hours and 18 minutes, two for Federer, who hit 53 winners to Berdych's 31 in a high-quality contest.
After dropping only one point on his serve as he eased 4-1 clear, Federer offered up two double faults that allowed Berdych to peg him back and earn a tie-break.
Again Berdych came back from an early deficit to trail 4-3 but a forehand error returned the advantage and Federer capitalised to clinch the set.
It was a blow for the Czech, but he fended off break points early in the second and kept pace with the seven-time champion.
Federer needed to produce a magnificent dipping forehand winner to hold serve at 3-3, and it was the same shot that would dominate the second tie-break.
Four brilliant forehands in a row gave the Swiss a 5-1 lead that proved enough for a two-set lead, and there was more magic off that wing in the third.
Berdych saw a chance to extend the contest disappear when Federer saved two break points with successive aces before breaking in the next game.
At 5-3, the Swiss produced a stunning forehand flicked pass that had the 15,000 spectators on Centre Court gasping, and moments later he served out victory in his 42nd Grand Slam semi-final.
Federer saved a match point on his way to beating Cilic in last year's quarter-finals, and said: ""Last time we had a brutal match - I was two sets down. I had to get lucky to win.
""Marin is a great guy. He's a lovely guy, in his first Wimbledon final.

Querrey, 29, had played three successive five-set matches to reach his first Grand Slam semi-final, and almost forced a fourth before Cilic finally saw off the American's challenge.
Both men had more than 100 aces to their name heading into the semi-finals, and it was the Croat who had more success in breaking down the big serve.
Cilic won more than twice as many points on return and earned 14 break points to Querrey's three, but the American saved 10 and was two service holds from taking it to a fifth set.
He edged the first set from 4-1 down in the tie-break before Cilic earned the first break of the match at 3-3 on his way to levelling at one set all.
The match was over two hours old before two loose shots from Querrey - a backhand error followed by a forehand into the net - separated the pair in the third set tie-break.
The pair's previous meeting at Wimbledon in 2012 lasted over five hours and finished 17-15 to Cilic in the fifth set, and when a wayward Cilic smash helped Querrey move ahead in the fourth, another final set seemed inevitable.
However, Cilic played a fine game to level at 4-4 with a drop volley and an attacking return of serve, and avoided the need for a third tie-break when he earned two match points at 6-5 and found a forehand winner on the second.
""Sam was playing high-level tennis, especially in the first set,"" said Cilic.

However, on a flat pitch Sangakkara remained untroubled, reaching his seventh Championship half-century of the season having hit eight boundaries.

"It's letting you search for every public tweet since its creation in 2006, roughly half a trillion posts.

On the other, it could flag up any user who may have forgotten about a potentially embarrassing post from their distant past.
In theory, it means anyone can look back at your FULL tweet history.
If you so wished, you could go back to the beginning of your timeline and see just how mundane - or thrilling - your early tweets were.
Perhaps more interestingly, you can search through your friends entire history, as long as they were posting publicly.
In a blog post which explains the complexities of its update, Twitter's said the new search service has been several years in the making.
Before, the search would give you a limited amount of results, with a focus on an individual's recent history or the recent appearance of a hashtag.
The advanced search has been expanded, offering you the chance to look back through a specific time period, with specific words or for a specific user.
If, for example, you search for a hashtag it will eventually start giving you the results it thinks are most relevant from its entire history in the 'top' tab, instead of the 'all' tab next to it.
You can now search for the earliest times a certain phrase or word was mentioned on Twitter.
The same goes for tracking a certain hashtag.
For example, did you know that Chris Messina, a former Google executive, was the first person to start using hashtags on Twitter back in 2007?
He's also the first person to have ever posted #justsayin.
The first time the word 'totes' was used on Twitter was in 2006, four years before it came to prominence in TOWIE.
Because of the size of the database, it takes an effort to go through every mention of One Direction, Katy Perry or Rihanna.
It's handy though for uber fans wanting to know exactly when and where their idols were in their early days.
For some, the prospect of a boss or parents looking back through your entire history with relative ease may fill some people with dread.
However, the tools were already in place to delete past tweets through Twitter itself and third party sites.

"Fifa's ethics committee is looking into the ""disloyal payment"", made nine years after Platini carried out consultation work for Fifa president Sepp Blatter.
Platini, a Fifa vice-president, and Blatter are serving 90-day bans while corruption claims are investigated.
In September, criminal proceedings against Blatter began in Switzerland.
BBC Radio 5 live sports news correspondent Richard Conway says a written contract did exist for Platini's work for Fifa between 1998 and 2002, according to sources. A total of SFr 1.05m (Â£710,000) is believed to have been paid to the Frenchman.
It is an additional SFr 2m (Â£1.35m) that was paid in February 2011 that is under scrutiny - and for which no written contract is said to exist.
Both Platini and Blatter are believed to have told investigators the additional payment was an oral agreement for SFr 0.5m to be paid for each of the four years (January 1999 to June 2002) the Uefa president was employed by Fifa. In a statement this month, Platini said ""the remuneration was agreed at the time"".
It is understood the men claimed an agreement to delay payment was reached at the time due to Fifa's then financial position.
Under Swiss law, an employee cannot seek to have a contract paid up after five years have elapsed irrespective of whether it was written or oral.
Both men have denied any wrongdoing, have appealed against their bans and believe they will be exonerated.
Uefa, which meets in Nyon on Thursday to discuss the issue, has said it has ""full confidence"" in its president and ""stands fully behind him"".
However, one Uefa executive committee member, Allan Hansen, has been quoted by Danish newspaper Ekstra Bladet as saying ""we can no longer support him"" - if no contract exists.
Meanwhile, Fifa has banned Thai football chief and former executive member Worawi Makudi for 90 days for an ethics breach and indicated he could face further punishment.","Uefa chief Michel Platini produced no documentary evidence for the 2m Swiss francs (Â£1.35m) payment made to him by Fifa, the BBC has learned.",34507539

Serious further offence reviews are held if crimes are alleged to have happened within 30 days of a sentence ending.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), which is investigating, confirmed Williams had been a resident at the Sirhowy Arms hostel, which houses vulnerable and homeless people, including ex-offenders.
It was there on Thursday that police found him attacking Ms Yemm, 22, who was from Blackwood.
Sources confirmed Ms Yemm suffered substantial facial injuries.
The community has reacted with shock to the murder and William Graham, a Conservative assembly member for South Wales East, said a ""wider inquiry into the circumstances surrounding his release is urgently required"".
""Questions must be answered by authorities and a full explanation provided on the  decisions taken in this extremely tragic case.""
The Ministry of Justice would not comment further. However, it is understood ex-offenders are not always subject to supervision if they serve their full sentence and have not previously been convicted of violent offences.
Details of Williams's previous offences and the length of sentence he received have not been confirmed.
Chris Evans, MP for Islwyn, said: ""This was a horrific and senseless crime that must be condemned without reservation.
""However, this is not the time for knee jerk reactions. A full investigation will be conducted by Gwent Police and the IPCC.""
Williams's family said it was in ""shock"" following the murder, adding it was ""devastated by the death of an innocent young lady"".
Ms Yemm worked in sales at Next and was formerly a student of Coleg Gwent between 2008 and April 2009. She had been studying health and social care.
Williams and Ms Yemm knew each other and police said they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the murder.
A post mortem examination of Ms Yemm's body is expected to take some time to complete.

"For many pundits the move comes as a surprise, because M-Pesa has been a huge success in other African states - especially in Kenya where it was launched in 2007.
The service allows people without bank accounts to transfer money quickly, easily and safely using their mobile phones.
According to a World Bank report, only 12% of Africans with bank accounts use mobile money services.
However, this is not the case in South Africa.
Mobile phone usage is high - nine in 10 South Africans own a mobile phone - and a third of these are smartphones, according to figures from the Pew Research Center.
Yet South Africa has the most technologically advanced, financially liquid and accessible banking system on the continent.
About 75% of adults in the country have bank accounts, a survey done by technology research body FinMark shows.
In a statement, Vodacom Chief Executive Shameel Joosub said the success of M-Pesa in South Africa hinged on ""achieving a critical mass of users"".
But Vodacom has struggled to find the customers. That is the problem.
M-Pesa was launched in South Africa in 2010, perhaps with the hope of capturing the energy and excitement of a nation hosting the football World Cup.
Trading on its position as the leading mobile operator in the country, Vodacom thought it could build an M-Pesa customer base of 10 million in three years.
However, six years on the service only has 76,000 active users in South Africa, although many more have been registered.
M-Pesa: The mobile wallet

Jambo pesa! (Hello, money! in Swahili)
A few reasons have been cited for its failure.
Vodacom had to partner with a bank to provide the financial service on its platform.
Nedbank was its choice - and although it is one of the largest banks in South Africa, the perception is that it caters for middle-class and high-income earners.
These customers already have an array of banking services and platforms through which to conduct their business.
South Africa is also a country where banks have actually made significant inroads in both urban and rural areas.
Though untested, it is said that there is a bank, branch or ATM within a 20km (12-mile) radius in any urban or rural settlement.
So the challenge in South Africa is not about access.
Rather it is the ability to use various technologies to support how people save, spend and invest their money.
In this regard, banks in the country are focused on developing new financial products that will enhance savings schemes and pension funds.
Mobile phone operators, on the other hand, are working towards opening more secure platforms - for instance linking banks, hospitals, retailers, insurers, municipalities and revenue services.
There is definitely still a case to be made for getting the unbanked population to open up accounts.
And statistics show this is the trend.
A 2015 KPMG report revealed that South African banks are growing at an annual rate of 7% and to date the industry has assets worth $361bn (ÃÂ£250bn).
The prospects for financial services are good.
Vodacom remains upbeat about the market in South Africa despite the failure of M-Pesa.
""We remain of the opinion that opportunities exist in the financial services environment and we will continue to explore these,"" Mr Joosub said
But the only real concern is the continued growth and stability of the South African economy.
The country has been facing severe economic storms caused by slow growth, a weakened currency, disinvestment in mining, factories closing down and unemployment on the rise.
These problems need to be tackled head-on, if communications, banking and services are to continue to thrive and create a new direction for this economy.

"Under the new rules, households will be fined $1 (ÃÂ£0.61) if their rubbish bins contain more than 10% food waste, and businesses and apartment buildings $50.
The city already recycles 56% of its waste but is aiming for 60% by 2015.
Seattle, in Washington State, is the second US city after San Francisco to make composting mandatory in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Composting is the processing of breaking down food and lawn refuse into useable soil through decomposition.
Up to 40% of food in the US is wasted, according to a report by the Natural Resources Defense Council.
Only 5% of food scraps are composted, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
Many Seattle homes and businesses have food compost bins but are not required to use them - now they will have to.
The city will begin issuing warning tickets on 1 January 2015 and fining customers on 1 July, according to the ordinance, which passed unanimously on Monday.
Under the new rules when Seattle garbage pickers see too much food waste in a rubbish bin, they will note it in a computerised system and the fine will be added to the customer's rubbish carting bill, local media reported.
Multi-unit flats and businesses will also be required to limit their food waste but will get two warnings before they are fined, according to the Seattle Times newspaper.
Seattle officials do not expect the programme to be a money-maker for the city, Tim Croll, the Seattle Public Utilities solid waste director, told the newspaper.
He added the city has collected less than $2,000 (ÃÂ£1,220) over nine years of a similar programme that banned recyclable items from the rubbish.
""The point isn't to raise revenue,"" Mr Croll said. ""We care more about reminding people to separate their materials.""

"Mr Swinney made the announcement as he unveiled his draft budget to MSPs in the Scottish Parliament.
He also announced a tax rise on many second homes and buy-to-let properties through a Land and Buildings Transaction Tax levy.
And Mr Swinney confirmed that the council tax freeze would continue.
The finance secretary warned that the Scottish budget was set to continue to reduce in real terms until the end of the decade, as he said it had done since 2010.
Opposition parties claimed that Mr Swinney was ""following where the Conservatives lead"" and that his budget would result in ""massive cuts"" to local services such as schools, roads and care of the elderly.
And local authority body Cosla warned that funding going to Scotland's 32 councils had been cut by 3.5% - meaning they would lose out on Â£350m between them.
Holyrood will be given limited powers over income tax rates next April under the 2012 Scotland Act, which was passed under the previous UK coalition government.
It will see the Treasury deduct from the Scottish block grant a sum equivalent to the product of 10p worth of income tax north of the border.
Mr Swinney then had the option of setting a Scottish Rate of Income Tax (SRIT) which could either be lower, higher or the same as the 10p that has been deducted.
The finance secretary told the Holyrood chamber: ""I propose that the Scottish Rate of Income Tax will be set at 10p in the pound - the rate people pay this year will be the same rate that they will pay next year.
""I hope that from 2017/18 this parliament will have more flexibility in setting income tax rates. However, that will depend on reaching agreement on a new fiscal framework and final passage of the Scotland Bill.""
Among the other measures proposed by Mr Swinney were:
Greater controls over income tax are among the measures contained in the Scotland Bill which is currently being scrutinised by Westminster, but these will not come into force until 2017 at the earliest.
Mr Swinney said that the Scottish government aimed to set out its longer-term plans on income tax ahead of the dissolution of the Scottish Parliament in March of next year.
He said that the Scottish government's aim was to focus on tackling inequality and boosting productivity in order to ""create the foundations for a stronger and more inclusive economy"".
But he said that would need to be delivered within a ""significantly constrained"" public spending environment.
Mr Swinney added: ""By 2020 our budget will be 12.5% lower in real terms than when the Conservatives came to power. That is the equivalent of one pound in every eight that we spend being cut by Westminster by 2020.""
He said that Land and Buildings Transaction tax, which replaced the stamp duty charge on property sales in Scotland, will remain the same for most transactions.
But he added: ""The exception to this is for buyers purchasing an additional residential property - such as a second home or a buy-to-let - worth more than Â£40,000, who will face an additional charge of 3% of the value.
Mr Swinney said this was ""proportionate and fair"", adding the new levy ""seeks to ensure that the opportunities for first-time buyers to enter the housing market in Scotland remain as strong as they possibly can be"".
Â£13bn
for 2016//17
Â£500m additional spending for 2016/17
6.5% increase on 2015/16
He also announced that he was allocating more than Â£500m to NHS budgets, which he said would result in total planned spending of nearly Â£13bn next year - an increase of 6.5% on the comparable figure for 2015/16.
But he warned that Scotland's ageing population meant that additional funding alone was not enough to equip it properly for the future.
Mr Swinney added: ""To really protect our NHS, we need to do more than just give it extra money - we need to use that money to deliver fundamental reform and change the way our NHS delivers care.""No change in Scottish income tax rate
Â£9,545m
Revenue funding for the country's 32 councils
Â£250m - new money for health and social care
Â£70m - to continue the council tax freeze
Â£88m - to maintain teacher numbers at 2015 levels
To this end, he said an extra Â£45m would be invested in improvements to primary care, with a further Â£200m funding six new treatment centres.
Mr Swinney said: ""This will equip the NHS to carry out increased numbers of hip and knee replacements and cataract operations, in a way that does not simply add pressure to our emergency hospitals.""
The draft budget is normally presented in September, but was delayed this year to take into account the Westminster spending review in November.
By BBC Scotland political editor Brian Taylor
In practice, John Swinney was holding steady in this budget - for understandable reasons. Firstly, there are big changes pending: reforming council tax, reviewing business rates, extra tax powers from the Smith Commission.
All that plus there is still no final deal on the Fiscal Framework which will accompany the Smith powers - although one is now firmly forecast for February.  All that adds up to a climate of arithmetical and political uncertainty.
But secondly there are elections to the Scottish Parliament in May. Mr Swinney does not lack fortitude but it would have taken a particularly courageous Finance Secretary (in the Yes Minister mode) to hike income tax, at the first time of asking under new powers, weeks before those polls.
Read more analysis from Brian.
Scottish Labour's finance spokeswoman Jackie Baillie said: ""This is the most important budget since devolution, delivered by a party who promised to stand up for Scotland against Tory austerity.
""But it doesn't deliver fairer taxes, a long-term plan for Scotland or an anti-austerity alternative. Local services like our schools, roads and care of the elderly will face massive cuts.""
Murdo Fraser of the Scottish Conservatives said Mr Swinney had chosen not to increase the resources available to him by levying additional taxes.
He added: ""For years, the finance secretary has portrayed himself as a prisoner of Westminster austerity, but now that he has been given the key to the door of his cell, he has decided not to use it.
""So I trust we will hear no more from the SNP about austerity and Westminster cuts, when the party itself has made the choice not to increase the size of the budget available.""
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said Mr Swinney ""has spent his entire political life campaigning for more tax powers. And what does he do when he gets them? The answer is nothing, no change, same rate and the same as in England.
""John Swinney cannot tell Scotland that he is rejecting austerity when he is not raising a penny more even though he has the new tax powers to do something about it.""
Cosla president David O'Neill said the cuts to council funding ""cannot be laid at Westminster's door this time around"".
He added: ""A cut of 3.5% is catastrophic for jobs and services within Scottish local government - because the harsh reality is that it actually translates to real job cuts that hit real families, in real communities throughout Scotland.  Everyone will be hurt by this.""",The finance secretary John Swinney has ruled out an increase in Scottish income tax when Holyrood gets new financial powers next year.,35106701

But pictures of the fashion range posted online have led to criticism on social media sites.
The shoes, which have collapsible heels and pointed toes, are available for infants up to six months old.
In the latest post on the company's Facebook page, an infant in heels sits astride a miniature motorbike with the caption: ""This little #Diva, defining cool posing in her #PeeWeePumps.""

"Former Gower AM Edwina Hart backed steel-coating firm Kancoat despite a warning of a ""weak"" business plan.
The Tories claim she may have broken the code because the firm was based near her constituency and she did not consult with the first minister.
The Welsh Government said the code was not broken.
Mrs Hart, who stood down from the assembly at the election in May, has been asked to comment.
Paragraph 4.4 of the Welsh Government's ministerial code, which sets out standards for their conduct, states: ""Where ministers have to take decisions on their own portfolios which might have a particular impact on their own constituencies or electoral regions, they must take particular care to avoid any possible conflict of interest.
""Where ministers are uncertain about whether a conflict arises between their ministerial and constituency/regional responsibilities they should consult the first minister, for a decision as to how the business is to be handled.""
A Freedom of Information request by the Welsh Conservatives found there was no record of any meeting between Mrs Hart and the first minister to discuss the granting of financial support to Kancoat.
Kancoat, which was based at the old Alcoa factory in Waunarlwydd, Swansea, was set up to coat metal used to make food cans and other products.
It was based less than half a mile outside Mrs Hart's Gower constituency.
Between May 2012 and February 2014 Kancoat was given a mix of loans and grants totalling Â£3.4m by the Welsh Government in decisions signed off by Mrs Hart.
The bulk of the support was given after the Welsh Government's own financial due-diligence reviewer raised concerns about Kancoat's financial projections in February 2013.
The review said Kancoat's business plan ""appears weak and inconsistent"" and the project was identified as high risk.
A request for support had previously been turned down by the government's investment arm Finance Wales due to an ""unacceptably high"" risk.
The company went into administration in September 2014.
A Wales Audit Office report in July revealed the company owed the government Â£2.6m - it created 12 jobs but ran into difficulties when it struggled to maintain its supply of steel.
Sir Alistair Graham, who chaired the UK's Committee on Standards in Public Life from 2004 to 2007, told BBC Wales he believed possible jobs for Ms Hart's constituents led to a potential conflict of interest.
Suzy Davies, Tory AM for South Wales West, said: ""The decision comes off the back of a series of poor financial decisions made by the Welsh Government.
""I feel strongly that there needs to be an overhaul of the ministerial code, which in its current state lacks independence and transparency.
""It cannot be right that the first minister is the sole arbitrator of these rules.""
Responding to the Conservative claims, a Welsh Government spokeswoman said: ""The previous minister did not break the ministerial code.""
The government had previously said the decision to support Kancoat was based on projections that more than 30 jobs would be created.
It has also pointed out that the factory was outside Mrs Hart's Gower constituency.
Asked in August whether Mrs Hart had broken the ministerial code, First Minister Carwyn Jones said: ""No, she didn't.
""Where do you draw the line? For example if a decision is taken supporting a business in Cardiff, that business might employ people from many many different constituencies in reality.
""People don't work in the constituency where they live.
""The rule we have is you cannot take a decision on something that affects your own constituency, or is within your constituency.
""But the reality is nobody could take any decisions if we said you had to make sure that absolutely nobody from your constituency worked in a particular business before we offered it support.
""So that's the rule we keep and no, she didn't break the ministerial code.""
Mr Jones said the former minister would not have needed to consult him about offering financial assistance to Kancoat ""because the rule is you do not take a decision as a minister on something that has a direct effect on your own constituency within your own constituency"".
A spokesperson for the Auditor General for Wales said his office is ""considering the merits of conducting a broader-review into Welsh Government funding of businesses in Wales"", which would include the funding of Kancoat.",An ex-economy minister has been accused by the Welsh Conservatives of breaking the ministerial code by approving Â£3.4m aid for a firm which later went bust.,37505302

"Too many over-65s end up in accident and emergency unnecessarily, says the NHS Confederation's Commission on Improving Urgent Care for Older People.
The group said this was because of a lack of help when they fell ill.
It called for radical steps, including providing urgent care at home and getting doctors to carry out ""ward rounds"" in care homes.
The commission's report said older people were ""poorly served"" and ""all too often forced to go to A&E"".
And once in hospital, they faced longer stays and losing some of their independence.
The report said older people needed more help navigating the complexities of the health and care system.
It pointed to an Age UK scheme in Cornwall, where the frailest people had co-ordinators helping organise their care.
It also said GPs could identify and work with patients most at risk of hospital admission.
The report also highlighted a scheme in north-east London, where hospital and ambulance staff were working together to provide emergency care in people's homes.
Nurses and paramedics assess and treat older people who have fallen but not suffered a fracture.
Equipment, such as walking frames, can be arranged.
And from April to July last year, seven in 10 of the patients seen had stayed at home.
Another project highlighted was in Hertfordshire, where GPs visited care home residents on a regular basis, with rapid response teams on call to attend to residents who needed urgent help.
Source: Commission on Improving Urgent Care for Older People
Dr Mark Newbold, who chairs the commission, said: ""Older people do need to access A&E at times, and the best hospitals tailor their service to meet their needs.
""But all too often, older people are forced to go to A&E because the alternative services that would help them be cared for at home are not available at the time they need them.""
A spokeswoman for the Department of Health in England said the government was fully supportive of the ideas put forward.
She pointed out a pot of money known as the Better Care Fund - amounting to ÃÂ£5.3bn this year - had been set aside to fund schemes largely focused on keeping people out of hospital.
The vision of improving care for older people was ""being realised"", she added.
Meanwhile, the Local Government Association has called for more to be done to tackle loneliness, now a ""major public health concern"".
Councillor Izzi Seccombe said it was increasingly being reported as an issue among older people referred to councils for care.
She said the solution lay in supporting befriending schemes and those that tackled social isolation, many of which were run by the voluntary sector.

I'm quite upset but happy because maybe Zayn will do good on his own but I'm upset because now there are only 4 boys in 1D.

I think that we will hear more from Zayn as a solo artist but I am upset.

One Direction have a lovely voice but now Zayn's left the four might sound horrible.

I feel let down because Zayn said on The X Factor that the band were definitely going to stay together and it wasn't the last of One Direction.
Laurel, Tamworth, England
Zayn Malik was great in the band and he does a lot of singing in the songs. I don't know what One Direction will do without him. Liam is my favourite but it won't be the same without Zayn. Bye Zayn!

I'm going to see One Direction in Cardiff in June and the concert won't be the same without him.

I don't understand why people are upset.

I can't believe it! He was one of the best. Will One Direction turn into Wrong Direction?
Sophie, East Sussex, England
I think that One Direction are great as a full band. Even though Zayn is not my favourite in the band, it still won't be the same without him. It was always the 5, but now its the 4. Before you know it, it will be the 3, then the 2, then a solo artist.
Robyn, Essex, England

"This has been a gruelling week for the primates of the Anglican Communion: 39 of them in total meeting for a make or break gathering, spending several days living, eating, praying and negotiating together in Canterbury over the future of the world's third biggest Christian grouping.
The meeting saw high stakes diplomacy by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby and his team, as the already fissiparous Communion threatened to split apart over the issue of same sex marriage.
The primates were kept well away from the glare of the media as the delicate talks got under way.
This was in the knowledge that comments in the public domain could prompt a walkout by the most traditionalist nations, who are part of Global Anglican Future (GAFCON) - a potential rival leadership should the Anglican Communion divide on this issue.
Their resolution was leaked on Thursday.
It shows that they have agreed that by recognising same-sex marriage, the Episcopal Church in the US departed fundamentally from the faith and teaching of the Anglican Communion on the doctrine of marriage.
The church will now be suspended from participating in the life and work of the Anglican Communion.
The resolution stated that there were no victors and no vanquished.
But LGBTi Christians and others are bitterly disappointed by the result and had hoped to see more support from the more liberal churches.
In the end, though, it seems that the Anglican Communion as a whole valued unity over diversity.
And there was clear strength of feeling at the meeting that for the vast majority of Anglicans represented there, marriage remains between a man and a woman, for life - even if secular societies in the west have moved rapidly over the past few years towards recognising equal or same sex marriage after years of similarly heated debate over the issue.
So what does the resolution mean?
It is clearly a shot across the bows for any other Anglican churches that may be thinking about changing doctrine unilaterally.
The Anglican Church of Canada, for example, takes a similar position on homosexuality to the Episcopal Church, though it has not yet formally endorsed services of same sex marriage.
Many of the provinces represented in Canterbury this week are having their own discussions about sexuality and whether to bless same sex unions in the future.
This is an issue that will not go away, even if the primates would like it to.
The Church of England itself is holding shared conversations on sexuality, in which LGBTi supporters and opponents are meant to share their views (although some participants have been critical of the reality).
In the end, the action taken over the Episcopal Church will not have a major impact on its congregations.
However, it will make many LGBTi supporters and those in favour of equality for all congregants question the Anglican Communion's claim to represent a loving church.
Although the deal represents a major achievement in keeping the Communion together, it remains extremely fragile.
And quite what walking together at a distance means in practice will be tested over the next three years.
Traditionalists will not be reconciled to same sex marriage, but nor will LGBTi Anglicans and their allies be ready to accept inequality indefinitely.
The power battle over who should lead the Communion in the future ÃÂ­with congregations growing in the global south, especially in Africa, even as they decline in the west, means that this is more of a stay of execution than a permanent reprieve for the Communion.
It is likely to find itself returning to exactly these themes at the next Lambeth Conference, the date of which could even be announced later.","As Anglican leaders bar a liberal US branch from decision-making for allowing same-sex marriage, the BBC's religious affairs correspondent Caroline Wyatt considers what this means for the Anglican Church.",35326234
"The Ibrox side were outclassed by their Glasgow rivals, only really threatening in the closing stages while 2-0 down.
Caixinha also admitted he changed his pre-match team talk on the advice of assistant Helder Baptista to ease tension among the players.
""By respecting the opponent we dropped off too much. It wasn't what we prepared during the week,"" he said.
Caixinha said he did not believe his game-plan had been unclear to his players, but he gave an uncommon insight into his pre-match approach.
""Helder came to me just at the end of the warm-up and told me 'please, in your speech, don't be so tough. They need to feel a little bit more freedom',"" the Portuguese added.

""When you don't feel that freedom you don't enjoy and you don't perform the way you need to.
""We were a little bit 'blocked' and if you're blocked - even if you have the best organisation and the best ideas - you can't perform.""
Caixinha said Baptista felt the players were tense, but stressed he did not believe they were frightened by the occasion or their opponent.
The Portuguese was asked about his tactics for the game, prompting a detailed response, outlining what he had hoped his players would execute.
""We organised our defending in three ways. The first one was to try to place a high block - if you see they were trying to build from the back - they open the centre-halves and Scott (Brown) is always in the middle. We had three players down there,"" he explained.
""In the middle of the park what we were trying to get them to play the ball to (Mikael) Lustig, block it, block Brown who was making the triangle with the centre-halves, and with this block we could have space to explore after we regain possession.
""We could not do it in this match because we were a little bit lower on the pitch. In the lower block, we were expecting not to allow them to divide the game.
""We just played wide when the spaces were inside. The idea was for our wingers to come inside and fill the space.""
Despite seemingly thorough planning, Caixinha accepted his strategy had failed to work.
""The game-plan is one thing, what we put in practice was a totally different thing,"" he acknowledged.
""So it wasn't our day. We couldn't perform the way we prepared. We expected more from our players but we need to keep going.
""After tomorrow's day off we need to get back to Murray Park to start preparing the next match and we still have five matches to go until the end of the season.""",Pedro Caixinha felt his Rangers team gave Celtic too much respect as they lost the Scottish Cup semi-final 2-0.,39685304
"Ritzy Cinema workers in Brixton get paid a minimum of Â£8.80 an hour. Bectu is calling for an increase to Â£9.40 an hour.
Union bosses said Picturehouse Entertainment is being ""very hard faced"" and has refused to negotiate.
Picturehouse said pay would rise to Â£9.10 an hour on 2 September as part of a three-year agreement with Bectu.
Balloting began on Tuesday and will end on 30 August.
Two years ago staff held 13 strikes over their pay and the minimum wage was raised from Â£7.53 to Â£8.40 in January 2015 and then to Â£8.80 in September.
The London living wage has since gone up from Â£8.80 to Â£9.40 per hour.
Bectu said the company rejected offers to hold talks at the conciliation service Acas.
The union also wants Picturehouse to address issues about treatment of new staff, maternity and paternity leave, and night pay.
Bectu's assistant general secretary, Luke Crawley, said: ""Bectu has tried to talk to Picturehouse but the company are being very hard faced in ignoring our pay claim.

"Items worth more than Â£36 sent from the islands will incur VAT from 1 January 2013. The limit was Â£40.
