Both myself and my family can now move on and I am so happy to have my life back - a life that I never knew existed.\\n\"Those people stole my life but the outcome of today\\'s trial means that they will now face the justice that they deserve.\"\\nJudge Neil Bidder QC said the three Connors, who operated a tarmacking business based at a farm in Rumney, treated their victims as little more than objects.\\nHe said: \"All the offences which you, Patrick Joseph Connors, have been convicted of are examples of conduct designed to keep two vulnerable men in what can only be described as modern-day slavery - in the case of Michael John Hughes, for 21 years.\\n\"By the end of that time he had been completely conditioned to being used by you as a serf.\"\\nThe court heard over the course of the trial, Patrick Joseph Connors forced Mr Hughes to work for him for long hours, paying him tiny sums or just with alcohol and tobacco.\\nMr Hughes was \"hunted down\" when he escaped and beaten \"all the time\", he said in evidence.\\nHe was made to live in \"appalling conditions\", including in a 1.2m (4ft)-wide garden shed with no heating or running water for two years.\\nThe court heard the only respite came when Mr Hughes was sent back to Scotland for unpaid fines and jailed. He said prison was \"like a holiday camp\" compared to his ordeal in Wales.\\nConnors senior was also convicted of eight counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm (ABH), four of kidnap and one charge of conspiracy to kidnap, while Patrick Dean Connors was also found guilty of kidnap.\\nThe jury was told to return not guilty verdicts on a charge of conspiracy to kidnap against Patrick Dean Connors and another of assault against William Connors.\\nGwent Police\\'s Ch Supt Paul Griffiths, who led the investigation, said: \"These types of crimes have a lasting effect on the victims - it is not just the physical degradation, it\\'s psychological too. It causes deep and long-lasting trauma.\"', 'The visitors were closing in on three points thanks to Christian Nade\\'s first-half penalty and a fine finish from Robert Thomson.\\nBut Martin Boyle\\'s late effort - after Daniel Harvie scored an own goal and James Keatings had a penalty saved - earned Hibs a point.\\nA mistake from goalkeeper Alan Martin handed Boyle the equaliser.\\nIt meant two lost points for Dumbarton, who fall behind Raith Rovers, into eighth spot after the Kirkcaldy side\\'s win over Dundee United.\\nDumbarton looked extremely well organised at the back in the first half, with space for the Hibs strikers at a premium.\\nAnd the visitors were awarded the chance to take a shock first-half lead when Marvin Bartley needlessly bundled Andy Stirling to the ground just inside the home team\\'s 18-yard box.\\nFormer Hearts striker Christian Nade made no mistake in despatching the ball beyond goalkeeper Ofir Marciano.\\nWhen the home side equalised through a Harvie own goal, few inside the ground would have expected anything else other than Hibs going on to secure a victory.\\nHowever, Thomson restored the visitors\\' lead with a stunning shot from 22 yards out to give the travelling support hope their team could secure their first win at Easter Road in more than 30 years.\\nMartin, on loan from Hamilton Academical, had an afternoon he is likely to remember for a long long time.\\nHe kept Hibs at bay with stunning saves from Keatings and Brian Graham. None better than the penalty stop from Keatings that denied Hibs an equaliser after they laid siege on the visitors\\' goal.\\nHowever, only he knows what he was thinking about when he dropped the ball on the edge of his box, allowing Boyle to nod the ball into the empty net to salvage a point.\\nIf, or indeed when, Neil Lennon manages to get his Hibs side over the line and secure their place back at Scottish football\\'s top table, he will have plenty to think about regarding who he should retain on the playing staff.\\nWith 10 draws in the league this season, the Easter Road side are far from the finished article and the inconsistency shown at times by many of his squad could lead them towards the exit door in the summer.\\nWith two huge games coming up in the next 10 days against their closest challengers, Falkirk and Greenock Morton, the league title could all but be in the bag.\\nHowever, any slip ups and those two, under two of the shrewdest managers around, Peter Houston and Jim Duffy, will look to pounce.\\nHibernian head coach Neil Lennon: \"I\\'m frustrated as we deserved to win the game. Ridiculous goals we are giving away.\\n\"Our attitude towards the game in the first half wasn\\'t good enough.\\n\"This team has to be more consistent. I\\'m not scratching my head because I see it so often now.\\n\"We are at home, but the malaise sets in and they are not learning.\\n\"If they think they are going to get to the Premiership playing like that, they won\\'t - and, if they think they are going to play like that in the Premiership, they will have to think again because it\\'s not acceptable.\"\\nDumbarton manager Stephen Aitken: \"I certainly enjoyed the performance of the players. We enjoyed the result.\\n\"It could have been a bit better, but if we are assessing the game in an honest manner then Hibs bossed the game in the second half.\\n\"The goalkeeper makes a save from the penalty, so we have to be happy. He is gutted about the equaliser, but at the same time, he kept us in the game.\\n\"He walked in and apologised for costing his team three points, but I said to him he gained us a point.\"\\nMatch ends, Hibernian 2, Dumbarton 2.\\nSecond Half ends, Hibernian 2, Dumbarton 2.\\nFoul by Brian Graham (Hibernian).\\n(Dumbarton) wins a free kick in the defensive half.\\nCorner,  Hibernian.

She took the baby out of the room and disappeared.\\nThe case brought significant media attention as Shanara tried to locate her child.\\nAlthough the biological family had been notified of the discovery and were \"elated\", the Jacksonville Sherriff\\'s Office said: \"It is up to the victim on how contact will be made.

It also provides for greater use of mobile phone blocking technology in prisons.\\nIn Westminster Hall (4.30pm) MPs debate e-petition 166847,  which complains that insurance companies are making it harder and harder for people aged 18 to 25 years of age to start driving.

This could become the template for more joint working between parliaments.\\nIn the Lords (2.30pm), peers will be have their second day of report stage debate on the detail of the Digital Economy Bill, where peers will consider clauses dealing with online pornography and age verification (including calls to ensure that data used for age verification to be kept confidential), social media abuse, Ofcom, the BBC licence fee (new clause from Lib Dem super-lawyer Lord Lester would require the PM, and all ministers and agencies to protect the independence of the BBC and reserve the licence fee exclusively for the BBC).\\nAnother new clause (32A) calls for the creation of an independent BBC Licence Fee Commission to recommend what the charge should be.\\nWatch out for New Clause 33ZG which aims to ensure the main public service broadcasters -  BBC1, BBC2, ITV1, Channel 4 and Five - are at the top of channel listings or Electronic Programme Guides on all TV platforms.

She\\'s concerned about the impact of letting through sites like Airbnb - you can let for 90 days, but many people are doing far more than that, and such letting a can breach mortgage agreements and insurance terms - and there\\'s a huge emerging problem about it invalidating the insurance for commonhold properties.\\nOther issues include controlling anti-social behaviour and tax evasion. Councils are having to monitor websites to keep track of letting levels on their patch and enforce the law...\\nMPs then dispatch the report and third reading of the Intellectual Property (Unjustified Threats) Bill  which deals with the problems of threats to sue for infringement being abused, to stifle new ideas and competition. This is an uncontroversial technical measure - and should be waved through with minimal debate. After that MPs will have a general debate on fuel poverty.\\nThe adjournment debate, led by the Conservative Will Quince, is on public health guidance and baby loss - he has spoken in the Commons about his experience of having his son stillborn.\\nIn Westminster Hall, debates include the relationship between the DVLA and private car parking companies - Kevin Foster (9.30am-11am);  the 60th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome - Stephen Gethins (11am-11.30am); the UN international day for the elimination of racial discrimination - Dawn Butler (2.30pm-4pm);  pensions in the nuclear decommissioning industry - Patricia Gibson (4pm-4.30pm) and Stoke on Trent, City of Culture 2021 - Ruth Smeeth (4.30pm-5.30pm).\\nMy committee pick is the Home Affairs hearing (2.15pm) on hate crime and its violent consequences, where the witnesses are all MPs: Lindsay Hoyle, the Deputy Speaker in charge of MP security, Home Office Minister Sarah Newton and the Solicitor-General Robert Buckland.\\nIn the Lords (2.30pm) the main event is a government debate on the current challenges to the international rules-based order; the preparedness of the UK\\'s armed forces and that of Nato; and the levers available to HMG to promote the country\\'s defence and security interests.\\nThis debate and a Statutory Instrument approval motion on the Armed Forces Act 2017, to maintain parliamentary approval for the armed forces, will be taken together.

MPs are expected to polish off the report and third reading stages of debate fairly rapidly.... and they will then move on to a general debate on exiting the European Union and global trade.\\nIn Westminster Hall, the subjects for debate include Iran\\'s influence in the Middle East (9.30am -11am) and the roll-out of universal credit (2.30pm-4pm) - Newcastle MP Catherine McKinnell says her constituency office has been \"overwhelmed\" with casework relating to the problems around the \\'Full Service\\' Universal Credit\\nMy committee pick is the Work and Pensions hearing (9.30am) on self-employment and the gig economy, with evidence from experts and think-tanks. This picks up on the Budget controversy around National Insurance for the self-employed.\\nIn the Lords (3pm) there are some amendments down for the third reading debate on the Higher Education and Research Bill , where the government has suffered a series of defeats at report stage, but they all come from the government spokesman, Lord Younger of Leckie, so they will be technical tidying-up or to meet assurances given during earlier stages of debate.\\nThen comes the final half-day of report stage consideration on the Digital Economy Bill, where more significant issues will be up for debate, including the rules on the \"Crown Jewels\" listed sports events, the suddenly topical subject of media mergers - watch out for a new clause proposed by Labour\\'s Lord Puttnam and the Conservative former cabinet minister Lord Lansley, which would require Ofcom to impose a \"fit and proper persons\" test for individuals involved in mergers of broadcasting and media enterprises.\\nThis would include looking at the \"extent of any criminal wrongdoing that has taken place by companies and other organisations under their control; and the extent of any failures of corporate governance and management in such companies and organisations\".\\nPeers will also look at new laws on ticket touting, including outlawing \"bots\" which buy up tickets online before fans can buy them - a practice which makes it difficult for ordinary folk to buy tickets without paying a considerable mark-up to online ticket touts.\\nThe Commons opens (9.30am) with International Trade questions followed by Women and Equalities questions, and the weekly Business Statement setting out the future agenda for the Commons. It\\'s also the last chance for the Leader of the House, David Lidington, to keep his promise to hold a debate on moving parliament out of its Victorian home before Easter.\\nThen the Conservative Bob Blackman leads a debate on the compensation due to Equitable Life policy holders in the light of the Parliamentary Ombudsman\\'s ruling that the collapsed company had not been properly regulated. The motion calls on the government to make a commitment to provide \"full compensation to victims of the scandal as the economy continues to recover\".\\nThe day\\'s second backbench debate, led by an interesting alliance of the former deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg; the former education secretary Nicky Morgan, and Labour\\'s Lucy Powell, a former shadow education secretary, on the annual State of the Nation report from the Social Mobility Commission. The motion highlights the Commission\\'s warning that social mobility is getting worse, and calls on the government to lead a renewed approach in the early years, in education, skills and housing, to improve social mobility.\\nIn Westminster Hall (1.30pm) there are debates on two select committee reports - on the Syrian refugee crisis, from the International Development Committee, and on DfID\\'s programme in Nigeria, from the International Development Committee.\\nIn the Lords (11am) peers debate the report from the Science and Technology Committee,  A time for boldness: EU membership and UK science after the referendum.  And then the report from the EU Committee: Brexit: environment and climate change.\\nThe Commons sits (9.30am) for its final day on the current crop of private members\\' bills.\\nAnd while the agenda lists an impressive number of bills for debate, in practice only the first few will be considered.\\nThe ones with top priority are the bills which have cleared their committee stage consideration, starting with the Conservative Wendy Morton\\'s pretty uncontroversial Local Audit (Public Access to Documents) Bill, which extends public access to certain local council audit documents.\\n\"I am ever the optimist for PMBs on sitting Fridays,\" she told me.

That might mean a few more clubs hanging on to their best players.\"\\nSwansea head coach Francesco Guidolin has said he expects interest in midfielder Sigurdsson this summer.\\nThe 26-year-old Iceland international won Swansea City\\'s supporters\\' and players\\' player of the year awards after scoring 11 goals in the club\\'s successful fight against relegation.\\nHe is under contract at Swansea until 2018, but has been linked with a number of big clubs, while Ayew has said his future depends on a summer discussion with chairman Huw Jenkins.\\n\"It\\'s the same every year for our club, we have players that come through, they do well,\" said Taylor, who was visiting his old school Ysgol Brynhyfryd in Ruthin before joining up with the Wales squad for their training camp in Portugal.\\n\"Gylfi is someone that has come now in two spells and done well for us. We want to keep hold of them obviously, Andre has scored goals.\\n\"But just like when we lost Wilfried Bony and people down the years and we lost Sigurdsson the last time, we do lose important players because they get poached by bigger teams.\\n\"It\\'s important that we try and keep them and add to that this season because we\\'ve realised how hard it is.\"\\nSwansea have been linked with summer moves for two of their former players - Manchester City striker Wilfried Bony and Liverpool midfielder Joe Allen.\\nIvory Coast international Bony joined City from Swansea for £25m in 2015, while Allen left for Liverpool for £15m in 2012.\\nBoth have struggled to nail down starting places at the north-west clubs and Taylor admits he would be delighted to see them return to west Wales.\\n\"There is a lot more work to be done than just somebody to say that we want them back. You have to talk about money, you have to talk about whether the players want to come back here,\" Taylor said.\\n\"They are both at big football clubs that are fighting for trophies, like Liverpool in the Europa League. There\\'s a lot more to happen before we bring those players in but people of that ilk are definitely people that we should be looking at.\"', 'The 1912 painting was purchased by the London gallery in early February.\\nThe museum paid Â£15.6m ($25.5m) for the artwork.
